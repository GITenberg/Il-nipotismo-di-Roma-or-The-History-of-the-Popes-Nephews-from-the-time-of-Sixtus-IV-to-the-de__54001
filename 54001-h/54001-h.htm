<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>The
Author to the READER.</h2>
<p>Kind Reader,</p>
<p><i>I should have much to say to thee</i>, <i>and not a few
Ceremonies to Complement thee withall</i>, <i>if two
Considerations did not make me resolve to hold my peace</i>,
<i>and abstain from that courtship</i>, <i>which would become a
Preface</i>.&nbsp; <i>The</i> first <i>is</i>, <i>because I will
not</i> (<i>as the Proverb sayes</i>) reckon without mine Hoste,
<i>and fill thy ears with excuses</i>, <i>before I know whether
thy intention be to hear them or no</i>.&nbsp; Secondly,
<i>because I think it will not be amiss to forbear Ceremonies in
the presence of so many</i>, <i>whose business it hath been to be
most accomplish&rsquo;d in performing of them</i>.&nbsp; <i>What
danger would there be for once</i>, <i>to let a Reader judge of a
Book</i>, <i>without all those troublesome informations from the
Author</i>: <i>For in a word</i>, <i>either the Reader hath parts
and learning</i>, <i>and then his own judgment needs no
instruction from the Authors</i>; <i>or he hath none</i>, <i>and
is illiterate</i>, <i>and then the Author loses his time in
</i><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span><i>excusing himself to one</i>, <i>whose abilities
cannot reach his subject</i>: <i>But this our age being so far
different from ancient times</i>, <i>wherein little notice was
taken of the Author</i>, <i>though much of the thing written</i>,
<i>it will be as just for him to inform his Reader</i>, <i>as for
a Suppliant to inform his Judge</i>, <i>though never so
learned</i>, <i>and to be recommended to him</i>, <i>though his
case be never so just</i>.&nbsp; <i>A Friend of mine</i>,
<i>calls the Advice to the Reader</i>, <i>the Sauce of the
Book</i>, <i>because it is that part</i>, <i>which gives us a
stomach to read the rest</i>.&nbsp; <i>I must confess</i>, <i>it
is for his satisfaction that I give you mine</i>; <i>I know not
how excellent it may prove to thy Palate</i>: <i>but my
intention</i>, <i>is not</i>, <i>at least</i>, <i>to put too much
Salt in it</i>; <i>and indeed</i>, <i>with what can I season
it</i>, <i>or what Ingredients have I left to compound it
withall</i>?&nbsp; <i>If I praise my own work</i>, <i>I shall
incur the censure of an interested Judge</i>; <i>if I dispraise
it</i>, <i>I shall do my self an injury</i>.&nbsp; <i>To tell
thee that this Book comes from</i> Rome <i>is in vain</i>,
<i>because the very Title of it discovers the place of its
birth</i>; <i>and to entreat thee to read it</i>, <i>would be
just the way to stifle thy curiosity</i>; <i>for now adayes</i>,
<i>every body desires the reading of those Books which are
prohibited</i>; <i>and I am certain</i>, <i>that it were a good
way</i>, <i>to incite the publick curiosity of the world </i><a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span><i>for any
Books</i>, <i>to intreat them that they would be pleased to let
them alone</i>, <i>for that</i>, <i>without doubt</i>, <i>would
encrease their desire of seeing it</i>.&nbsp; <i>I think I had
best do as those Hunters</i>, <i>who for fear of raising the
Partridge too soon</i>, <i>talk to one another so softly</i>,
<i>and so low</i>, <i>that they scarce hear themselves
speak</i>.&nbsp; <i>Therefore</i>, <i>Reader</i>, <i>take
notice</i>, <i>this is that famous</i> Nipotismo di Roma, <i>so
much desired and wished for by all the ingenious of</i> Europe,
<i>before it was brought forth by the Author</i>.&nbsp; <i>I give
thee warning to read it in private</i>, <i>and keep it to thy
self</i>; <i>for if the news of thy reading it come to the</i>
Inquisitors <i>ears</i>, <i>without doubt thou runnest the hazard
of an Excommunication</i>; <i>for they have sworn</i>, <i>to
indure no Books in</i> Italy, <i>but those that shall flatter
the</i> Court of Rome.&nbsp; <i>It is indeed a good policy for
them</i>, <i>and for those Church men</i>, <i>who having
pretensions to the highest Ecclesiastical Honours</i>, <i>stand
all day before the</i> Nipotismo <i>with their Caps in their
hands</i>.&nbsp; <i>I know</i>, <i>that in</i> Rome <i>this
History will produce the same effect that our Nails do upon a
Sore</i>, <i>that is</i>, <i>the more they scratch it</i>, <i>the
worse they make it</i>: <i>Yet the itching pleases every
body</i>, <i>and the more we scratch</i>, <i>the more we have a
mind to scratch still</i>.&nbsp; <i>Neither do I doubt</i>,
<i>but that there will be some </i><a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span><i>flatterers and false friends of
the</i> Nephews <i>of the</i> Popes, <i>who will express their
dislike of this Treatise</i>; <i>but it will be only in
appearance</i>, <i>and not from their hearts</i>, <i>which may be
forgiven them</i>, <i>for seldome in</i> Rome <i>do the Tongue
and the Heart correspond</i>.</p>
<p><i>In the dayes of</i> Innocent <i>the eighth</i>, <i>some
body made a Book</i>, <i>intituled</i>, The Abuses of the
Churchmen, <i>very satyrical</i>, <i>for in it were all the
Ecclesiasticks Vices</i>, <i>but none of their Vertues</i>,
<i>which indeed was somewhat severe</i>: <i>This Book was put
into the</i> Popes <i>hands</i> (<i>who by judging things without
passion</i>, <i>shewed himself to deserve his elevation to so
great a dignity</i>) <i>for having read it in the presence of
some</i> Prelates <i>of the</i> holy Office, <i>he turned to
them</i>, <i>and said</i>, This Book speaks truth; and if we have
a mind that the Author should be found a lyar, we had best reform
our selves first.&nbsp; <i>I wish to God</i>, <i>that in this our
Age</i>, <i>there were many such</i> Innocents, <i>and that all
men were of so sound a judgment</i>, <i>as to profit by good
things</i>, <i>and laugh only at ill ones</i>, <i>or rather avoid
them</i>: <i>For my part</i>, <i>I think</i>, <i>that if ever
there hath been a Book in this world free from a flattering
design and interest</i>, <i>that this is one of those</i>; <i>for
the Church of God will profit by it</i>, <i>the</i> Romans
<i>will draw no small pleasure nor less </i><a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span><i>advantage
from the reading of it</i>; <i>and</i>, <i>I hope</i>, <i>that it
will be a kind of Looking-glass to the</i> Nephews <i>that are to
come</i>, <i>whereby they may guide their actions</i>, <i>and
steer their intentions to a better course then their
Predecessors</i>.&nbsp; <i>There passed</i>, <i>not long ago</i>,
<i>by this Town</i>, <i>a certain</i> Prelate <i>of</i> Tuscany,
<i>to whom I gave a sight of this</i> Manuscript <i>before it was
printed</i>; <i>he took such delight in perusing of it</i>,
<i>that he entreated me to hasten the publication of it</i>,
<i>with these words</i>, For Gods sake, Sir, inrich <i>Rome</i>
with so great a Treasure as this is; bestow so good an example
upon Princes Politicks, and illustrate all <i>Christendome</i>
with the demonstration of so much zeal: <i>This was the opinion
of a sincere</i> Prelate.&nbsp; <i>But besides</i>, <i>it is most
certain</i>, <i>that the</i> Nephews, <i>as well those that now
bear sway</i>, <i>as those that are out of date</i>, <i>and those
that are to come</i>, <i>if they will judge without
pre-occupation</i>, <i>will find</i>, <i>that this History is of
no small concern to the promoting of their interest</i>,
<i>considering</i>, <i>that the good which is said of them doth
much surpass the ill</i>, <i>and</i>, <i>that it demonstrates how
necessary a thing the</i> Nipotismo <i>is to the</i> City of
Rome.&nbsp; <i>I do not pretend to any thanks or retribution for
the good that shall happen to them</i>; <i>neither would I be
content</i>, <i>that the harm</i>, <i>if there </i><a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span><i>be any</i>,
<i>should reflect upon me</i>.&nbsp; <i>As for the Book</i>,
<i>Reader</i>, <i>it is in thy hands</i>, <i>and must stand or
fall by thy verdict</i>: <i>I therefore only desire thee to
pronounce sincerely</i>, <i>whether it be not as necessary for
all</i> Europe <i>as for the City of</i> Rome.&nbsp; <i>I promise
thee another Work</i>, <i>much more worthy thy curiosity</i>,
<i>and fit for any body that hath a publick Employment</i>,
<i>which is</i> Il Cardinalismo, <i>a Work</i>, <i>which speaking
in general only of that Dignity</i>, <i>doth yet nevertheless now
and then descend to particulars</i>.&nbsp; <i>In a word</i>, <i>I
call the</i> Cardinalismo, <i>and the</i> Nipotismo,
<i>Brothers</i>; <i>but the</i> Cardinalismo <i>is the
eldest</i>, <i>because first conceived by me</i>; <i>in a moneth
it will be Printed</i>; <i>if thou wilt have it</i>, <i>thou
mayest</i>, <i>and I can assure you</i>, <i>it will please you
infinitely</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap"><i>Rome</i></span> alone amongst all the
other Cities of the World can brag of the reputation, of having
been alwayes esteemed the Mother of Nations, the whole Universe
having almost alwayes taken a pride in paying to her a Tribute of
filial Duties, in acknowledgment of which she has also opened her
breasts, and pressed her Duggs for the nourishment of those who
desired to encrease by their obedience to Her, and be free from
those dangers to which they are subject that have not Parents or
powerful Protectors.</p>
<p>The glories of <i>Rome</i> were never equalled, no more then
<i>Rome</i> it self.&nbsp; <i>Rome</i> hath been seen in all the
Cities of the World, not only commanding, <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>but triumphing;
and in <i>Rome</i> have been seen at divers times, not only
Cities, but whole Provinces, nay, whole Kingdomes, obeying, and
submitting.&nbsp; <i>Rome</i> seems to be born to rule the World,
and with a great deal of reason, since not only it hath done, but
doth still exerce its Empire over a great part of it.</p>
<p>It ruled while it was a Commonwealth; and not content with
that Empire which nature, or to say better, the valour of its
Citizens had purchased for it, it proposed to acquire all that it
could think on, and still the acquisitions seemed small in
comparison of that which remained to be acquired.</p>
<p>It rul&rsquo;d in the time of the <i>Roman</i> Emperours, who
made Lawes, and domineered over mankind as they pleased; nay,
which was worse, tyranny it self came often from <i>Rome</i> to
infect the rest of the Universe which was subject to this seat of
Tyrants.</p>
<p>But why should we recall past Ages, and renew those wounds,
which though not healed, are nevertheless worn out by the length
of time; why should we praise <i>Rome</i> for having ruled the
World, if now at this present it rules it more then ever, and
domineers over it in a new manner.</p>
<p>In the time of the Commonwealth, in the time of the Emperours,
<i>Rome</i> never pretended to command consciences, and exact
from soules that Tribute which now they pay to the
<i>Vatican</i>.</p>
<p>Every City had its Bishop, every Village its Curate, and every
Church its Preacher, who in his Sermons did not make it his
business to exalt <i>Rome</i>; neither did the Bishop, nor the
Curate <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>expect the rules of governing their flock from
<i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>But now quite contrary maximes have prevailed; for
<i>Rome</i>, not content with the temporal power, hath perverted
the order of Government, and made the temporal submit to the
spiritual, contrary to the received custome of so many Ages.</p>
<p>If the Commonwealth subdued Nations, if the <i>Roman</i>
Emperours commanded over kingdomes, they did it in such a manner,
that those that obeyed seemed to have had more content then those
that commanded; for they let them enjoy the liberty of their
souls, and required only from them a Civil Obedience in
compliance with the interest of the State.</p>
<p>But the <i>Popes</i> having confounded and mingled together
the temporal and spiritual power, laying the stress upon the
spiritual, do oblige Princes and people to so exact an obedience,
that the only mention of it is able to scare our hearts and
minds.</p>
<p>The <i>Popes</i> shutting of Paradise and Heaven when they
please, their opening of Hell when they think good, are things
that oblige whole Nations to forget the Obedience due to their
natural Princes, and to prostrate themselves at his Holinesses
his feet.&nbsp; The Commonwealth which ruled with so much wisdome
and Policie, the Emperours who governed with the strength of
Arms, and the Tyrants who domineered with cruelty, had they but
known these secret maximes, might have humbled Nations and
reduced Cities with a great deal less paines, and more
security.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>The
<i>Popes</i> having being armed with the Soveraigne Authority
over consciences, have so increased the glories of <i>Rome</i>,
that there is scarce a corner in <i>Europe</i>, not a place in
<i>Asia</i>, not a desart in <i>Africa</i>, nor a hidden solitude
in <i>America</i>, where the name of the <i>Pope</i> hath not
penetrated, and where there is not some discourse of
<i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Gentiles</i> praise the <i>Popes</i>, and despise
<i>Rome</i>; the Hereticks praise <i>Rome</i>, and despise the
<i>Popes</i>; and the Catholicks despise both <i>Rome</i> and
<i>Popes</i> with a greater, though secreter, disdain, then
either the <i>Gentiles</i> or the Hereticks, of which I shall
give the reasons.</p>
<p>The <i>Pagans</i> attribute all the mischief of <i>Rome</i> to
that great number of Church-men with which this City is
pestred.&nbsp; The Hereticks, on the other side, lay all the
Church-mens disorders upon the <i>Pope</i>; and therefore the
Hereticks are willing enough to be reconcil&rsquo;d to
<i>Rome</i>; but by no means will endure the <i>Pope</i>.&nbsp;
The <i>Pagans</i>, on the contrary, are content to be friends
with the <i>Pope</i>, but not with <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>This proceeds from the distinctions that the Heathens make in
the person of the <i>Popes</i>, separating the spiritual from the
temporal, and Religion from Civil Government; therefore in the
time of <i>Sixtus</i> the V. and <i>Gregory</i> the XV. the
<i>Persians</i> and <i>Japponeses</i> sent their Ambassador to
<i>Rome</i>, taking no small pride in the <i>Popes</i>
friendship, whom they esteemed as one of the powerfullest Princes
of <i>Italy</i>, and for his greatness desired his Amity; their
maxime being to make alliances with the most potent Princes of
the World; they thought they could not better address themselves
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>then to him,
whom all the other Christian Princes did adore and reverence as
their head.</p>
<p>The Hereticks destroy all this, being neither disposed to
acknowledg the <i>Pope</i> as a temporal Prince, nor as a
spiritual Pastor; so that with them, Popedome, Principality,
Religion, Civil Government, all goes down, when they speak of the
<i>Pope</i>.</p>
<p>Nay, I know a Gentleman of that Religion, who can by no means
be perswaded that the <i>Pope</i> is master of <i>Rome</i>, and
Prince of the Ecclesiastick State, though all the Princes of the
world acknowledg him to be so, and for all this, the Protestant
Gentleman cannot be brought to believe it, but stands firme upon
the Negative.</p>
<p>Of the same humour was a great Lord in <i>Spain</i>, who could
never be convinced, that <i>Henry</i> the fourth was King of
<i>France</i>, though he knew that his own King did acknowledge
him for such, and had sent an Embassadour to him, that all
differences upon that subject were lay&rsquo;d, and that all the
Crowns in <i>Europe</i> did own him to be lawful King.&nbsp; And
yet for all this the good Don could never believe that which all
the world was sure of, and he died in this incredulous
humour.</p>
<p>Now as for the murmurs that the <i>Gentiles</i>, the
Hereticks, and the Catholicks have against <i>Rome</i>, there is
this difference between them.&nbsp; The Heathens murmure upon
what they hear; the Hereticks against those things that they do
not believe; and the Catholicks against those things they see;
and certainly of them all the Catholicks murmurs are the worst:
for the eyes being as it were the <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>treasurers of the heart, do furnish it
so abundantly with the impressions which they receive, that it
never is dispossessed of them afterwards; the Proverb being very
true, which sayes, <i>That in vain we fly from that which we
carry in our hearts</i>.&nbsp; Therefore the Catholicks,
murmuring boldly, because they see the abuses of <i>Rome</i>, are
much more believed then the others.</p>
<p>But indeed to speak truth, if we ballance the reasons that
these three sorts of persons have to talke disadvantagiously of
<i>Rome</i>, we shall find that the Hereticks have the greatest
and most weighty arguments of their discontent.</p>
<p>But before I prove this, it is necessary to give notice that I
make a distinction betwixt Hereticks and Protestants, though the
Church of <i>Rome</i> does confound both these denominations; for
they are Hereticks who deny the true Religion for a false one,
which they set up without any foundation of reason, thinking that
their own opinion is enough.</p>
<p>The Protestants are those that abhorre innovations, and do tie
themselves to the sense of the Holy Scripture, denying every
thing they find not in those Sacred Records: and for my part, I
intend to speak only of the Protestants, not of the
Hereticks.</p>
<p>Let us return to our subject; and say, that the <i>Popes</i>
do neither good nor harme to the Heathens; to the Catholicks they
do both good and evil; and to the Protestants alwayes ill, and
never good.&nbsp; Looking upon the Heathens as neater, upon the
Catholicks as their friends, and upon the Protestants as their
greatest enemies.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>From
thence it proceeds that the Catholicks are more scandalized at
the <i>Popes</i> errours; for they being friends are admitted to
dive into the bottom of the disorders: The Protestants seeing
that the <i>Popes</i> do not only suspect them, but openly
profess enmity with them, do busie all their industry in
penetrating into those hidden mysteries of the Court of Rome,
that they may not be surprised, but have wherewith to defend
themselves in their disputes: and therefore that which they
report of the Court of <i>Rome</i> is most ordinarily true.</p>
<p>The Heathens let <i>Rome</i> alone as long as <i>Rome</i> lets
them alone; and they talke according to the informations they
receive from Catholicks and Protestants.</p>
<p>Whosoever therefore intends to draw a quintessence of truth
out of so many different relations, must not give credit only to
what the Catholicks say; for they being friends and dependants of
the <i>Pope</i>, cannot do less for their own reputation, as well
as for his, then to hide the abuses and palliate the disorders of
his Court; neither ought he to take his informations from the
Protestants alone, because they, being prepossessed with an
aversion to the <i>Pope</i>, cannot chuse but be blinded by their
pre-occupation, and say more then is true, in discredit of the
proceedings of his Court.</p>
<p>The method of History would require a strict examination of
the relations of both parties in matter of fact, and a ballance
of their opinions in matter of policy, and upon so mature a
discussion it were fit to frame the body of the History, and
found the maximes of policy; for the History would then be true,
and the maximes certain.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>This hath
alwayes been my way of writing, insomuch that many, both
Protestants and Catholicks, have not been able to distinguish my
Religion in my works, nor know whether the Author were Protestant
or Catholick; and this because of the sincerity with which I
praise, in both parties, that which deserves commendation, and
blame vice, let it be where it will, and in what place and person
soever.</p>
<p>But to say true, this present age hath so corrupted and
perverted the art of writing, that some write only to flatter,
and others to satyrize; and there is no ingenious Catholick but
must confess, that there are publish&rsquo;d every day more
Libels by the Catholicks against <i>Rome</i>, then Satyres by the
Protestants against the Popes; therefore now adayes the wiser
sort of men give more credit to a Protestants relation, then to a
Catholicks, meeting with less passion in the first then in the
last, against the Popes and <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>I have been a great while in Protestant Countries, and have
likewise made no small stay in <i>Rome</i>, where I have heard a
thousand and a thousand times, both Romans and Protestants,
discourse of the Popes Nephews, and their actions; but I must
confess, that in <i>Geneva</i> it self I never heard any
discourse so full of liberty, nor so satyrical, as those which
the Romans, nay the Prelates themselves have vented in my
presence, concerning the Popes and the Ecclesiastick
authority.</p>
<p>Nay, I&rsquo;le say more, and it is a thing I am very sure of,
having heard it often said by persons of great understanding; the
Protestant Gentlemen that travel to <i>Rome</i> are much more
scandalized at <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>the Romans proceedings towards the Popes, then the
Catholick Gentlemen, who travel in Protestant Countries, are to
hear the Pope defam&rsquo;d and ill spoken of amongst them.</p>
<p>The Protestants, when they talk with Catholicks, because they
cannot reasonably expect to be believed, do conceal the greatest
part of the imperfections of the Popes kindred; but the
Catholicks say a great deal more then becomes them, thinking
thereby to show their aversion to vice.</p>
<p>More then all this, I say, that of all that is said in
<i>Rome</i> concerning the Popes actions, and his kindred, there
is none of it comes from the North, but from <i>Rome</i> it self;
but on the contrary, even all that is said in the North, springs
from <i>Rome</i>, and is not born in the Protestants Country.</p>
<p>The Romans make the Pasquins in <i>Rome</i>, and then to
excuse themselves lay them upon the Protestants: thus the Pope is
abused and deceived by the Romans themselves; so that then we may
say with a great deal of reason, that out of <i>Rome</i> it self
springs the source of all the harm it receives.</p>
<p>I wonder now no longer to see the change of stile which I have
observed in Writers from age to age, since in the Court of
<i>Rome</i> they change their way of living and speaking from day
to day.</p>
<p>In the time that the Popes had golden consciences, and wooden
walls, when with bare feet and clothed with sackcloth they went
from door to door, accepting the charity of the faithful for <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>their
sustenance, and that full of zeal they administred themselves the
Sacraments, exposing their lives for the safety of their
flock.&nbsp; When the Popes applyed themselves only to their
pastoral charge, without concerning themselves in Princes
temporal interests: <i>Rome</i> in those dayes knew nothing of
other Princes Courts, neither did the Courts of Princes concern
themselves for <i>Rome</i>; there was so little mention made of
the Popes, that the Church-men and Bishops did scarce know where
to find them in their most important necessities.</p>
<p>It would have been indeed a great sacriledge to have spoken
ill of a Pope, who from morning to evening did nothing but visit
the sick, distribute the Sacraments, comfort the people, and
serve the Altar with true zeal and piety.</p>
<p>But when once the face of things was changed, and that the
Popes, weary of serving to the Altars, resolved to be served by
the Altars themselves, when thinking it too low an employment to
visit the sick, they pretended to be visited themselves by the
greatest Princes, and have their feet kissed by them; these
<i>Popes</i>, who were at first the edification of whole Nations,
became a scandal to all the Kingdoms, for both Princes and people
being surprised with this sudden change, and wondring at this new
scene of grandeur, gave themselves up to seek into the reason of
this alteration, and as it often happens, that in the Enquiries
into one defect we discover another, so the world found out in
the Popes change so many new subjects for murmuring and
discontent, that from thence ensued Schismes and Heresies, <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>with an
infinite prejudice to the Church of <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>If the Popes would have been content to have been the heads of
the Church in holiness and good life, and not in majesty and
grandeur, the world would never have conceived so many sinister
thoughts of their actions; therefore if there be murmurs in
<i>Rome</i>, and the rest of Christendome, the Popes may thank
themselves, for the fault is not in those that murmur, but in
those that furnish them with a lawful subject for their
complaints.</p>
<p>But let us speak truth: In the time that the Popes left to the
Emperours the secular care of government, and all the interests
of the temporal state, holiness and good life did shine in the
Popes, as well as in the Church and Church-men; miracles were
frequent, and Saints multiplied as fast as tyrant Emperours.</p>
<p>But as soon as the Popes usurped the civil power, and began to
meddle with state matters, their holiness disappeared, miracles
vanished, and by a strange mutation the Emperors became Saints,
and the Popes as passionate for the temporal interest as the
greatest Tyrants.</p>
<p>The Hereticks go further, and say, that the Popes are really
Tyrants, as having introduced the Inquisition, which by
constraining mens consciences to an exteriour worship of what
they abhor, does more severely punish the breach of one of the
Popes Orders, then it does the violation of one of Gods
Commandements.</p>
<p>To this the Popes oppose, as a defence, the reason of policy,
that obliges them to establish the <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Inquisition, leaving to their Divines
the task of answering the other more sharp objection; who having
no other way to extricate themselves from that difficulty, have
written, to confute the Hereticks, such vast volumns of
Controversie, that they being not able to read them, remain in
their obstinacy, with no small dammage to the Pope and his
Divines.</p>
<p>But this strange change of the Popes, from spiritual to
temporal, and from holy Bishops to Politick Princes, is not so
much to be attributed to the Popes themselves, as to their
Nephews and kindred, there is the source and origin of the
disease; for while the Popes lead a private life, and let their
Nephews alone in their own homes, they were eminent for their
zeal to the true Religion; but they had no sooner introduced them
into <i>Rome</i>, but forgetting themselves, they fell to
idolizing their Nephews, and for the increase of their greatness,
employed not only the gold of the Church, but even all the pains
and fatigues of the Popedom, nay even the consciences of their
whole flock.</p>
<p>Experience teaches us, that many Popes, and particularly those
of the greatest reputation, in the beginning of their Popedome
did not only renounce their kindred, and refuse to own them, but
with a solemn oath did protest to the Cardinals, that they would
govern alone, and not admit their kindred upon any pretext
whatsoever; so far they were from giving them a share in the
government.</p>
<p><i>Alexander</i> the seventh, who now lives, was one of those
for a time, and from him we may conclude <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of the
thoughts of the rest; for in the beginning of his Pontificat he
shewed himself to be so averse from his kindred, that some
thought him a Saint, or at least a man much above the frailties
of humane nature.</p>
<p><i>Don Mario</i> his Brother, <i>Don Agostino</i> his Nephew,
and the Cardinal that now is, did every day offer up their
prayers to Heaven, for a change in their Uncles inclination; the
Ambassadors of Princes and the Cardinals, did nothing but weary
themselves out in alledging to his Holiness the necessity of
introducing his kindred, that it would be not only honourable,
but of great advantage to the State and Church.</p>
<p>Yet the good Pope remaining unshaken in his opinion, was
resolved to deny all their Instances, nay, often would be
exceedingly scandalized at those that pressed him to it, saying,
he could not in conscience condescend to their desires; as one
day being importun&rsquo;d upon the same occasion by Father
<i>Palavicino</i>, a Jesuit, and his Confessor, who now is
Cardinal, he answered him in these words, <i>Your obligation</i>,
<i>father</i>, <i>is to absolve from sins</i>, <i>and not invite
to commit them</i>.</p>
<p>Of this humour hath not been <i>Alexander</i> alone, but in
the lives of the Popes there are many other such examples, as
that of <i>Adrian</i> the sixth, and <i>Pius</i> the fifth, who
were wont to say, <i>that they would make it their task to
perswade the world that they could live without kindred</i>.</p>
<p>Now I would fain know, from whence proceeded in them this
humour, so opposite to the others? if from an aversion and a kind
of hatred to their relations, then certainly it was a sin, <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>since we have
as a Commandment from God, <i>Despise not thy own flesh</i>; if
to make shew of an apparent zeal, that was worse, for they were
guilty both before the world and God Almighty; if out of a design
of first bestowing kindnesses on their Friends before they gave
themselves up to their Nephews, it was a preposterous charity,
which ought to have begun nearer home.</p>
<p>It remains then to conclude, that certainly these Popes, who
made this profession of disowning their Relations, did it,
because they were really perswaded, that the errors of their
predecessors did proceed from this principle of admitting their
kindred to a share in the government, and therefore they thought
fit to free themselves from so great an imputation.</p>
<p>Therefore to save the reputation of the Papal dignity, I am
forced to say, that those Popes, who at first did profess an
aversion to their kindred, and yet afterwards admitted them, were
certainly seised with some melancholy humors and capriciousness,
which made them commit such errors.&nbsp; It must not seem
strange if I call them errors, since reason it self must needs
call them so; for first, to be perswaded that their predecessors
had failed in admitting their kindred into <i>Rome</i>, and in
giving up the government of the Church into their hands; then, to
swear and protest to keep theirs at a distance, that they may be
freed from the like miscarriages; and after all this, not onely
to call them into <i>Rome</i>, give them the Keys of the
treasure, and put all the administration of the temporal and
spiritual into their hands, whereby to make themselves Princes,
but also to give them <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>an absolute authority over the
Church, the Popedome, nay, the very person of the Pope; this is
certainly to demonstrate, that the Pope hath the power of making
that to be good and just, which he hath condemn&rsquo;d for bad
&amp; mischievous; which if the people of Rome, or the Courtiers,
do believe, certainly people of judgment and sound understanding
do not.</p>
<p>As for me, I have not hitherto denyed that opinion of the
Roman Divines, <i>viz. that the Popes cannot erre</i>; but when
once I came to see the falsity of it proved in the person of
<i>Alexander</i> the seventh, certainly I have had a mind to
curse those Divines, that flatter thus the Popes, not out of a
design to serve the Church, but to make themselves great; and we
know very well, that there are now many of them living, who have
been made Cardinals, meerly because they had writ to the
advantage and honour of the Pope, which thing still stirs up
others to do the same; but let them write what they will, all the
world shall never perswade me, but that the proceeding of
<i>Alexander</i> towards his kindred, in calling them to him,
contrary to his oath, is as great an error as ever Pope
committed.</p>
<p>Yet let us do them the favour to interpret their Doctrine
their own way, and allow of their distinction, that is, that the
Popes are infallible in matters of faith, but not in matters of
policy; let it be so; but if we do them this kindness, I hope
they will be so civil as to requite it with another: we desire
them then to tell us a little; The Popes Nephews, have they not
the same authority as the Popes themselves, who invest them <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>with it as
soon as they are admitted into the <i>Vatican</i>, they govern
all affairs, politick, civil, Ecclesiastick, and in a word,
sacred, prophane, divine, all things pass through their
hands.&nbsp; Then with them sometimes the Popes may erre, even in
matters of faith, since often in matters of faith they trust
their Nephews, who being men subject to passions, are admitted by
all to be capable of error.</p>
<p>I would fain ask you, whether <i>Alexander</i> the seventh,
who had so great an aversion to his kindred at first, had the
assistance of the holy Ghost, or whether he had it not?</p>
<p>If you answer he had it not, I am well pleased, and do profess
with you, that I think that policy and humane reasons were the
causes of his proceedings.</p>
<p>But if he had the holy Ghost, how then can you reconcile his
first refusing to admit the calling his Nephews to his
assistance? for either it was good or bad to admit them to his
help in so great a charge; if good, then he failed at first in
keeping them away, and shewing himself so alienated from them; if
bad, then he failed at last, in repealing his first resolution,
and betraying the Church and its riches into their hands.</p>
<p>The holy Ghost is infallible, and to believe the contrary is a
high impiety; how is it then that the <i>Popes</i> have the holy
Ghost, and yet cannot abstain from failing? certainly to me it
appears a kind of Blasphemy and prophanation of the honour of the
Divinity.&nbsp; We know that the holy Ghost inspires nothing but
what is good, and yet we see that the <i>Popes</i> do commit
ill.&nbsp; The Protestants <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>do utterly deny this opinion, and
demonstrate by good proofs, that the Pope neither hath, nor can
have the holy Ghost in a more particular manner then other men;
but for my part I believe that the holy Ghost is in the Popes
when he pleases, and they receive him when they can.</p>
<p>So to save the reputation of Pope <i>Alexander</i> the
seventh, I&rsquo;le say, that in the beginning of his Pontificat
he had not the holy Ghost, for if he had, he would have received
his kindred; but the holy Ghost begun to take possession of the
Pope, just at the same time that his kindred took possession of
<i>Rome</i>, and of the Church; and therefore the good man was
much to blame to keep the holy Ghost and his kindred out so long
together, since by this means he deprived himself of the riches
of the Spirit, and his Relations of the riches of this world: But
now he hath mended his error, and made amends for all.&nbsp; Many
believe that the Popes erre with their kindred, and their kindred
with them; but for my part I believe that the Apostles did not
erre, because that they received the holy Ghost from Jesus Christ
himself; but the Popes do erre because they receive the holy
Ghost from the Divines, who give it them, how and when they
please: I know what I say.</p>
<p>Often <i>Rome</i> hath lost the order of its government,
because it was become a prey to the ambition of its Subjects; and
as often it hath been brought upon the brim of its ruine, by gold
and riches.</p>
<p>Old <i>Rome</i> had much ado to preserve it self by an
infinite number of severe Laws, and at last did <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>make a shift
betwixt good and bad times, to rub out some Ages, till new
<i>Rome</i> came and took its place.&nbsp; By old <i>Rome</i> I
mean that <i>Rome</i> that was founded by <i>Romulus</i>, and
ended at the time of our Saviour: and by new <i>Rome</i> I
understand <i>Rome</i> that was born in Christ, and lives even
now in him.&nbsp; Now if the ancient City of <i>Rome</i> came to
its ruine through ambition and covetousness, it will become us to
consider what effects these very same things do produce in our
new <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>When we speak of <i>Rome</i>, we speak of a City that desires
to be acknowledged by all Nations, as the head of
Christendom.&nbsp; Now let us see the difference between the
Pagan and the Christian <i>Rome</i>, the old and the new.</p>
<p>In the time that our Saviour was born in <i>Bethlehem</i>, to
destroy this old <i>Rome</i> of the Heathens, and give the
foundation of this new Christian City, <i>Augustus</i> not only
commanded, that all the Nations of the Roman Empire should be
numbred, to shew, that with the coming of Christ there was a new
Empire begun, but likewise he brought all the world into a calm
peace and tranquility; so that our Saviour no sooner appeared,
but peace was the joy and comfort of the whole Universe.&nbsp;
Christ chose to be born in a time of peace, and not of war and
misery, for two causes: First, to set a difference betwixt the
new and old <i>Rome</i>; the old having been founded in blood and
dissention, under the government of <i>Romulus</i> a Pagan, it
was more then just, that the new should begin with peace, under
the dominion of the King of Kings, the holy One of
<i>Israel</i>.&nbsp; Secondly, to the end that the Successors of
the <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Apostles, who were to reside in <i>Rome</i>, might not
one day excuse their faults, with alledging the beginnings of the
Christian Religion for example; and therefore our Saviour took
possession of <i>Rome</i> in peace, and delivered it to those
Popes, who were to govern <i>Rome</i> and
<i>Christendome</i>.</p>
<p>To Christ succeeded Peter, to <i>Peter</i> the Popes, as the
Divines of <i>Rome</i> teach, and do endeavour to prove, against
the Protestants, as a principal point of Religion.</p>
<p>The Popes then took possession of this new <i>Rome</i>, with
the holiness of life; and when first they established this
Ecclesiastical Senate, they chose out men so holy, and of so good
a life, that the Citizens willingly submitted to prostrate
themselves at the feet of such Governours.</p>
<p>Ambition was then so far from the hearts of the Bishops, that
not only many Prelates did renounce their Bishopricks, but also
many retir&rsquo;d from the <i>Vatican</i>, where they were
adored, into deserts and solitudes, to serve God their Creator
without trouble.</p>
<p>Gold had not yet found the way to <i>Rome</i>, because there
was no hand that would receive it, no Treasurer to keep it, and
all its glittering was much below that vertue, which did so
eminently shine in those that were the Guardians of
<i>Rome</i>.&nbsp; Woe would have been to that man, who should
have opened himself a door to preferment in the Church with a
golden Key; the Excommunications, the Laws, the pains of this and
the next world, were fulminated against Simony, which was as much
abhorred by all the Church-men ther, as it is now practised.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>In one
thing alone old <i>Rome</i> did not agree in its beginnings with
the new; for one promoted to its highest honours, those Citizens
who had shed their blood, and could produce noble scars received
in the defence of their Country; but the other bestowed Offices
and Ecclesiastical Dignities upon those, who in consideration of
another world did despise this, and mortified their flesh and
affections.&nbsp; The <i>Roman</i> Empire rise by Valours, the
<i>Roman</i> Church by Holiness.</p>
<p>The Actions of those, that pretended to any place of publick
employment in old <i>Rome</i>, were examined by the Senate; and
the services, which the State had received from these Candidates,
were as it were ballanced with the honour they ambitioned, and
the weight of the place they stood for: and if those services
were such, as to be able to weigh down these scales of equity,
the Candidate was sure to obtain his desires; if they proved too
light, he was forced to stay, and with new Endeavours encrease
the obligation the publick had to him already.</p>
<p>Just in the same manner did the Popes at first proceed in the
distribution of the charges of the Church; for having ballanced
the holiness of life, and excellency of parts of him who was to
be admitted, with the weightiness of the place; if the goodness
of life was so eminent, as to surpass the exigency of the Office,
the Demandant was without delay preferred, otherwise he was sent
away with shame and confusion.</p>
<p>The Conquests of Kingdoms, and the subduing of Provinces, were
the Keys, with which the <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span><i>Romans</i> opened to themselves
the door of honour, and an entrance into the Senate; but in new
<i>Rome</i>, persecutions, martyrdoms, and mortifications, were
the fore-runners of Christian Dignities, and the only way to
Bishopricks and Popedoms.</p>
<p>While the Popes lived thus, and that this age of holiness
lasted, it was with a great deal of reason, that the rest of the
world called their <i>Rome</i>, <i>Roma la Santa</i>, <i>Rome</i>
the holy: The Popes were looked upon to be more like Angels then
Men, not only because their actions were altogether heavenly, but
because that living in this world, without owning any of their
kindred, they seemed rather sent from Heaven, then taken from the
midst of mankind.</p>
<p>There hath been some Popes, who while they were Bishops and
Cardinals did reckon an incredible number of Nephews and Cozens;
and yet no sooner were they promoted to the highest Prelature,
but all their kindred vanished and disappeared, as if they had
never had any.</p>
<p>If in those times you had asked any of them if they were a-kin
to the Pope, he would have denyed it openly, so little did the
Popes care for their kindred, and their kindred for them: The
cause of this was, that the Popes did not measure in their
kindred their deserts, by any carnal affection they had for them,
but compared their merits by the Standard of Christian
perfection; so that if a Kinsman of a Pope should have happened
to have had, for competitour in any place, one not much above him
in learning and piety, yet without doubt he should have yielded
to <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>this
his Competitour, and gone without his pretensions.</p>
<p>Hence it came, that the Popes kindred, that they might not
receive affronts in <i>Rome</i>, did forbear to come at the City;
and least the world should by their absence conclude of the
meanness of their deserts, they would give it out, that they were
in no wayes related to the Pope, whose kindred they were, saving
thus their honour without honour.</p>
<p>In those times, the Popes did often resist the Emperours
tyrannical proceedings, and withstood their injuries, not with
Armies and Fleets, but with Zeal and Piety they did boldly oppose
their vices and corruptions; as amongst others, <i>Gregory</i>
the seventh excommunicated the Emperour <i>Henry</i>, and
banished him from all commerce with the rest of his Christians,
only because he had received I know not what sum of money from a
Bishop, who us&rsquo;d his favour to be preferr&rsquo;d to a
vacant Bishoprick.</p>
<p><i>Rome</i> was then truly holy without ambition, and without
gold; and glorious were the Popes, who with their zeal and good
actions made barbarous Kings tremble, and Tyrants humble
themselves to the yoak of Christian Religion; and indeed who
would not obey that Pope, that should prefer true merit and
deserts before Relations and Kindred, Vertue before Vice,
Learning before Ignorance, Zeal before Ambition, Poverty before
Riches, his flock before his Kindred, and Justice before Favour
and Recommendations?</p>
<p>But if hitherto we have spoken of <i>Rome</i> without <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>corruption,
and of Popes full of zeal and holiness, so we must now consider
<i>Rome</i> under another habit, that is, not holy, but wicked,
not pure and innocent, but defiled and full of ambition and
avarice.</p>
<p>While the Popes lived in this retired manner, devested of all
earthly affections to their kindred, and inclin&rsquo;d only to
recompence deserts and goodness, <i>Rome</i> was happy and holy;
but as soon as Christian modesty began to be banish&rsquo;d by
worldly pomps, that favour took place of merit, that ambition
overpowered humility, and covetousness laughed at charity, the
Popes began to lose their credit, <i>Rome</i> its goodness, the
Church its Saints, and there started up another Church, another
<i>Rome</i>, and other Popes.</p>
<p>And no sooner did the love of riches take possession of
<i>Rome</i>, but <i>Christendom</i> was engaged in desperate
Schisms, with no small affliction to the real and pious part of
the Christian world.</p>
<p>Two hundred and twenty six years after the birth of Christ,
the Popes began to change their poverty into riches, and with
them introduced ambition into the Church; this was done in the
time of <i>Urban</i> the first, who ordained, that the Church
should possess land, riches, power, command, and all other
conveniencies, to the end that Church-men might be rewarded out
of the revenues of the Church it self.</p>
<p>Before <i>Urban&rsquo;s</i> time, Ecclesiasticks were to trust
to the alms of the faithful, and their charity; and whilst that
lasted, they thought of nothing else then the conduct of Souls,
having no care to take, either for the encrease or conservation
of <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>their
Fortunes; but as soon as they saw the Church enriched with
Abbyes, Canonicates, and other revenues, they fell to disputing
among themselves, every one desiring the possession of the
richest benefice.</p>
<p><i>Urban</i> in doing this had neverthelesse no ill intention;
and if his Successors had followed his steps, the revenues of the
Church had certainly animated <i>Romes</i> greatness, and yet
deminish&rsquo;d nothing of the Churches riches.</p>
<p>When I speak of the riches of the Church, I mean, not the
temporal, but the spiritual riches, as St. <i>Laurence</i>
understood it, when being asked by the Emperour where were the
riches of the Church, he produced before him a multitude of poor
impotent beggars, but of a good life.</p>
<p>Therefore the Church became poor in Saints, and rich in
ambitious Ecclesiasticks, who did now employ that time which they
used to spend in the Churches, and at the feet of our Saviour,
with the Popes and Bishops, in reckoning up the Revenues of their
Abbies, and procuring preferments to themselves and others.</p>
<p>The bringing of temporal riches into the Church was a poison
which infected the Church, and made the Church-men swell,
&rsquo;till at last they were ready to burst with their own
venome.&nbsp; As the Church encreased in revenues, <i>Rome</i>
decreased in Holiness and Holy men, and Saints forsook it when
once Courtiers and men of business came into it.&nbsp; I meane
living Saints; for as for dead Saints there are too many in it
still, it being a part of its Trade to doe now for Gold and
Riches, that which before was done by poverty and self-denial, I
mean, Canonising of Saints.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Before
the Church enjoyed temporal revenues, there was modesty in the
Church-mens Apparel, but with the introduction of riches, pride,
pomp, and vanity took place; then were invented Mitets, Scarlet
Robes with long Traines, Copes, and Tippets; so that with the
expense that one is at now to cloath a Prelate or a Cardinal many
poor might be fed and covered, and particularly poor Priests, who
are faine to beg from Laicks that which their own Prelates should
bestow upon them.</p>
<p>Though things were carryed on with this corruption, yet was it
not come to that pass that the Popes durst bring their Nephewes
to the Sterne, and Government of St. <i>Peters</i> Vessel; they
were content to rule the temporal and spiritual without controle,
but did not think of entayling the Popedome upon their kindred,
which made their Nephews and Relations keep at a distance, being
unwilling to be seen in <i>Rome</i> without command and
power.</p>
<p><i>Nicholas</i> the third in the year 1229, went about to make
two of his Nephewes of the House of the <i>Ursins</i> Kings, one
of <i>Toscany</i>, and the other <i>Lumbardy</i>, to the end that
one should keep the <i>Germans</i> in awe, who have one part of
the <i>Alpes</i>, and the other the <i>French</i>, who were then
Masters of the Kingdomes of <i>Naples</i> and <i>Sicily</i>: and
that he might compass his designe with lesse trouble, he
perswaded <i>Peter</i> King of <i>Arragon</i> to undertake the
recovery of the Kingdome of <i>Sicily</i>, to which he had a
right by <i>Constantine</i> his Wife.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>But all
these designes soon vanished and were buried in the Tombe of the
<i>Popes</i> brain, where they were first conceived.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis true, that many say, that the <i>Pope</i> did this,
only to satisfie the pressing instances of his Nephewes: but
because he affected more the quiet of the Church, then the
advancement of his kindred, he persisted not in his enterprise,
but just as long as was necessary to make his Kindred believe he
had once well resolved it; and thus the <i>Ursins</i>, who
aspired to so much Grandeur, remained disappointed, and the
<i>Pope</i> was pleased in the demonstration he had given them of
His kindness.</p>
<p>The <i>Popes</i> were not yet perfect in the art of raising
their kindred; the carnal love of their Relations did but begin a
combat with the spiritual zeal for the Church, and as yet the
last was too hard for the first, and in all occasions did carry
it before their kindness for their Relations.</p>
<p>From <i>Nicolas</i> to <i>Sixtus</i> the Fourth, who was
created in the year 1471, the <i>Popes</i> did by little and
little humanise themselves, and lay aside that rude severity to
themselves, and to their kindred, who now began to come very
willingly to <i>Rome</i>, being sure to meet with kinder
receptions then heretofore had been shewed to precedent
<i>Popes</i> Relations; and when once they were in <i>Rome</i>
and in sight of their Uncle, he to prevent them from leading an
idle life, would give them entrance into the Vatican, and honour
them with places of Honour and Profit.</p>
<p>Withall this things were carried so closely, that though the
Church did receive some detriment, <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>yet the people of <i>Rome</i>, and
the other Christian Nations had no great occasion of scandal
given them neither from the Nephews, nor from the Popes.&nbsp;
The first of which were well pleased with any thing that was
given them; and the last, that is, the <i>Popes</i>, were so
provident as to be liberal only of what was superfluous, and not
of that which the Church and <i>Rome</i> could not spare.</p>
<p>But in the time of <i>Sixtus</i>, Ambition and Covetousness
introduced themselves so openly, with the utter destruction of
the modesty and decorum of the Church, together with the
subversion of Christian Piety, occasioned all by his filling the
<i>Vatican</i> with such a company of Nephewes, that from that
time forward we must reckon the birth and growth of the
<i>Nipotismo</i>; in the History of which, before we engage any
further, it will not be amiss to give a Character of the Court of
<i>Rome</i>, which now at present is maintained by, and depends
entirely upon the <i>Nipotismo</i>.</p>
<p>One of the greatest extravagancies that I meet withall in the
World, is the error of those who are perpetually exclaiming
against Courts; and generally &rsquo;tis observed, that few of
those that are of this Humour, have been Courtiers, or if they
have, yet have they not made any considerable stay in them.&nbsp;
But for Gods sake, what kind of thing was the World, before there
were any Courts? nothing but the refuge of baseness, the
quintessence of ignorance, an apparent blindness, and in a word,
a barbarous throne of Vices, and all sorts of ill actions.</p>
<p>Many complain of the Court, but few of themselves, for not
having been able to maintain the <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>ground, and keep the place they had
once in it; as if the Court were bound to descend to a compliance
with every particular mans humour, and not particular men rather
frame themselves to a condescendency for the Court.</p>
<p>Who is it that frames and constitutes a Court? &rsquo;tis the
Prince, without whom there is no such thing.&nbsp; But who brings
Vices to the Court?&nbsp; The Courtiers; and yet though the
Courtiers be bad, and the Prince good, all the fault is laid upon
the Prince.</p>
<p>Princes seldome fayle to recompense those services which they
receive from their Courtiers, and without this quality they would
not long be Princes.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, that some are more
reserv&rsquo;d, others more liberal in their rewards; but still
the defect is not in the Prince, but in the courtier, whose
ambition is not to be ruled by his Princes judgment, and against
whom he exclaimes for not contenting him.</p>
<p>To the ambition or desire of honour is alwayes added an
avidity or desire of riches in Courtiers: these two monsters
being the natural production of Courts.</p>
<p>The Court is to the World, as a furnace to Gold, to purifie,
and refine mens wits.&nbsp; Whensoever any bodies ingenuity is
under a cloud, and not known, let him come to Court, for there
without doubt he will be prest to an exact trial of his skill;
and let him use it all in hiding himself, and drawing as it were
a vayle over his designs, yet he shall find the Court to be the
true Touch-stone of mens actions, and he shall be known, for what
he is really, and not for what he would seem to be.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>This
general discourse is only, that we may descend with more light
and instruction to particulars.&nbsp; All other Courts, are
streams, and rivers; but the Court of <i>Rome</i> is the head and
source of them all; and as ordinarily we find out the head by
following the stream, so I thought it fit to say something in
general of Courts, before I came to the description of the Court
of <i>Rome</i>.&nbsp; Among all Nations in the World, the
<i>Italians</i> are the most famous for managing State Affairs,
and being naturally inclined to be good Politicians.&nbsp;
Neither do the Princes of the North deny this advantage to the
Courts of our <i>Italian</i> Princes, who in the Government of
their States, are masters of so much conduct, and subtilty, that
none but very excellent and experienced geniuses can penetrate
the depth of their Counsels.</p>
<p>But those maximes and Court slights, which in <i>Italy</i> are
ordinary, are as it were natural and inseparable from the
Church-men of the Court of <i>Rome</i>; which City, upon this
score, is become famous in all forreign Countries, not as a place
that teaches, and instructs Church-men, but as one that is taught
and perfected by them.</p>
<p>He that desires to see politick stratagems, and all that
subtilty can compass, let him not forsake <i>Rome</i>, where he
shall soon learn how State Affairs ought to be managed.</p>
<p>I alwayes had a great opinion of the cunning and abilities of
Church-men in matter of Government; but when once I came to
<i>Rome</i>, and began to know by experience something of their
wayes, I must confess, that my imagination was far short of the
reality of what I had conceived.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>It was
no hard matter for <i>Rome</i>, both the old, and the new, to be
mistress of the World, and give Lawes to Nations, since it hath
alwayes been the School of true policies, as having even in its
birth drained all the rest of the world of its cunning, and
impoverished, it in slights to enrich its self.</p>
<p>For the space of fifteen Ages, the Church-men have already
demonstrated to the world their abilities, and subtilty; and that
so much the more to the wonder of all, because their beginnings
have been so different from the means they have us&rsquo;d,
shifting from one thing to another, and changing upon all
occasions, as Seamen do their Sailes with the wind, so that they
seem to be born entirely for their own profit.</p>
<p>In the first Ages of the Church, the Court of <i>Rome</i>
thought it convenient to comply with the Courts of other Princes,
and this slight had its effect, while the Emperours Tyrannised
over <i>Rome</i>; but their Tyranny being destroyed, the Court of
<i>Rome</i> chang&rsquo;d its way, and desired a compliance from
all other Courts to its self.</p>
<p>Yet this proceeding too, having by little and little,
intricated, and perplex&rsquo;d the Court, and Courtiers, they
were fain to come back to their first complyance, and by all Arts
appease the male-contents, and keep those that were affectionate
from being alienated: but now the face of things is so changed,
and the nature of transactions so perverted, that they which now
command in the Court of <i>Rome</i> have invented new wayes how
to carry themselves, and correspond with Princes, very intricate,
and different from those that were us&rsquo;d in past Ages.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>Therefore there are very few who having resided in this
Court, do at last forsake it to return home, but they have a
great deal of reason to complaine and be ill satisfied of its
proceedings; not only because they had not found so much favour
as they had expected; but because they found that they had been
meerly deluded with faire promises, and at last, as it were
laughed at for their paines.&nbsp; For the Courtiers of
<i>Rome</i> have a particular maxime, either of perplexing, or of
jeering those that come to negotiate with them.&nbsp; The truth
is, they have been so subtle in providing for their interest, and
have brought things to that pass, that they seem to be able to be
without those, who can by no means be without them; upon which
score the Ministers of some Princes were wont to say; <i>That
Negotiations in the Court of Rome were a mischeif to those that
were employed in them</i>, <i>but a very necessary one</i>: And
in a word; The Court of <i>Rome</i> cannot be better compared,
then to a Labyrinth, out of which, many think they are going,
when they do but just enter it.</p>
<p>Many have compared it to the Monky, that hugs its young ones
to death; for just so do the Churchmen, who embrace every one
with a paternal affection; but in those embraces, they that
receive them, find their ruin.&nbsp; Therefore have a Care of
<i>Romes</i> kindness.&nbsp; Others do compare it to a Tree laden
with fruit, that to look upon, seems ripe and fair, which when
you come to taste, you find soure and crabbed.</p>
<p>For my part, I think the Court of <i>Rome</i> is like those
pills that Physitians give to their patients, <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>which are all
gold without, that they may not displease the sick person by
exposing to his view Cassia, or Antimony, &amp;c. and he, poor
man, trusting to this glorious exteriour swallowes the Pill, and
in the swallowing of it often perceives the bitterness.</p>
<p>So <i>Rome</i>, or rather the Church-men in <i>Rome</i>, cover
every thing with the gold of their inventions and slights, giving
thus to Princes and Nations most bitter medicines covered with
the zeal of Religion, which they have no sooner swallowed, but
they find that there was nothing but an appearance of good in
it.</p>
<p>In the Court of <i>Rome</i> it often falls out, that he that
makes as if he knew all mens intrigues is altogether ignorant,
and he that feigns to know nothing, knowes all.&nbsp; The
exterior shew of goodness runs like a stream in the sight of all,
but it springs from a head of mischeif, which is seen by few,
because there they seldome give the sting without the honey.</p>
<p>Nothing is done in <i>Rome</i> without the zeal of Religion;
and yet the zeale of Religion is that which prevailes least in
all things.&nbsp; For they make a great distinction between those
things that they desire, and those that they ought to do.&nbsp;
They employ all their resolution and their prudence towards the
compassing of the first, but they seldome performe the last, as
not being inclin&rsquo;d to make their wills stoop to their
duty.</p>
<p>These maximes, or the like, are common in all the Princes
Courts, both within and without <i>Italy</i>; but <i>Rome</i> is
the Seminary of these Arts, in which the Church-men are
masters.</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>He that
goes to negotiate in <i>Rome</i> as a publick Minister from some
Prince or State, must first have made some stay in it as a
private person; and for my part, I am perswaded, that to have
good success in such an employment, one stands in need of that
double spirit which <i>Eliseus</i> asked <i>Elias</i> for; since
that Church-men are so double-souled, as to use nothing but
slights and subtilties in their negotiations.</p>
<p>He that can live four or five years in the Court of
<i>Rome</i>, without meeting with such impediments as shall make
him stumble and go neer to fall, may live a whole Age in any
other Princes Court without trouble.</p>
<p>We see every day by experience, that many excellent
Politicians, Ministers of Princes, and States, who in other
Courts had got a great deal of credit and reputation, by managing
business to their Princes content, are no sooner come to
<i>Rome</i>, but in an instant they lose all that honour that
they had taken so much pains for.&nbsp; And indeed many are they
that come to the Court of <i>Rome</i> with a great deal of
credit, but few come off and leave it with honour and
reputation.</p>
<p>In a Climate subject to so many sudden changes, they that live
in it must expect thunder and lightning, as well as fair
weather.&nbsp; There negotiations must needs be hard, where the
face of things is changed every day.</p>
<p>Many publick Ministers lose themselves in <i>Rome</i>, because
they know well where they are, but not with whom they are: for
whilst they think they have to do with a Monarchy, of a sudden
they meet with a Republick and a <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Senate; and when they imagine to be
engaged with a commonwealth and a Senate, they find they have to
do with a Monarchy: so that like a ball they are tossed from the
Monarch to the Senate, and back again: Because indeed, the
government of <i>Rome</i> is a Monarchy without a Head, and a
Commonwealth without Counsellors.&nbsp; And thus even they that
reside long in <i>Rome</i> are often puzzled in such sudden
changes.</p>
<p>The Government of the Popes is much different from that of all
other Princes; because that they that are raised to this eminent
degree do often come to it, so raw and ignorant of Policies, that
they are a great while before they can attain to any perfection
in their charge, which when they have done at others expences, it
is time for them to leave the world and their government to their
Successours, who most commonly are of the same past fortune,
introducing Church-men to this so high a command, and nature
hurrying them away from the throne before they are fit for
it.</p>
<p>I do not wonder, that in the Court of <i>Rome</i>, through a
long experience, even the dullest and rawest Politicians do
become at last most expert; since that from all the parts of the
World, <i>Rome</i> receives none but the wisest and most able
Statesmen to negotiate with her.</p>
<p>One of my friends compares this Court to the Sea; for as it
receives in its bosome all the Rivers of the Earth, and being by
them filled and swelled, fills them again from whom it received
its plenty.&nbsp; So <i>Rome</i> doth as it were suck from the
rest of the World, their purest milk of policies, and distributes
it again, like a kind mother, to all those <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>that are
content with the appellation of its children.</p>
<p>Indeed as for the sucking part, I think my friend is much in
the right; for Church-mens lips are so fit for this function,
that they lose not one drop; but as for the distributive part,
they make it a more difficult thing then he or others would
imagine.</p>
<p>Neither do I wonder at it, for when they deal with others,
they alwayes propose to them the zeal of Religion, and the
interest of Christian Piety: While under the pretext of these,
they hide their self-policy, to use it in time and place
convenient: Which no body can discover but themselves.&nbsp; The
truth is, that a good Politician may receive some benefit, by
diving into that which they so much endeavour to hide; but he
shall never be advantaged by any thing that they shall willingly
reveal to him, their undoubtted maxime being never to discover
any thing but such as they need not, or that cannot be beneficial
to others.</p>
<p>To give a great proof of what I say; I remember, that an
Embassadour of an <i>Italian</i> Prince, a wise and able man,
being returned home after seven years stay in his imployment at
<i>Rome</i>, could give to his master for all account of his
Embassy, nothing but ambiguous words, equivocal enigmes, and
uncertain answers; whereupon his Prince not understanding him,
required a better information at his hands, and was thus answered
by him.</p>
<p>Serenissime Prince: <i>The School of</i> Rome <i>hath
furnished me with no other Lectures</i>, <i>then what I</i> <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span><i>have
already layed open to your Highness</i>: <i>Therefore with all
due submission</i>, <i>I beseech your Highness to have compassion
of me</i>, <i>if I appear before you so barren and so empty</i>;
<i>for in seven years time I have not been able to obtain from
these Church-men any solid substance</i>, <i>to fill my self
withal</i>.&nbsp; This &rsquo;tis that befalls most Ambassadors
and Agents in <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Innocentius</i> the Tenth had brought the Court into such a
confusion; that in his time no body knew where to begin any
business: For he did so little care to trouble himself with the
important affairs of Christendome; that most commonly he refused
to meddle, even in those which concerned his pastoral
function.&nbsp; His troublesome houres were when he was forced to
give audience to a forrain Embassadour, and to be rid of
business; his maximes were, To deny all favours, to answer all
requests with a negative, and never to come to a final resolution
in any thing that might please his enemies; though the thing in
its self was very beneficial to the Church and State.&nbsp; If he
had any inclination to do good, it appeared only in what he did
to his own family, and in the care he took to embellish the City
of <i>Rome</i>.&nbsp; But the ill he did was not contained in
such easie limits, it spread its self over all Christendome,
which did lament to see the Church provided of so extravagant a
Pastor.</p>
<p>In the beginning of his pontificat, he shewed himself much
enclined to be well informed of the state of <i>Rome</i>, and the
Church Territories; which vigilance of his, at last redounded to
the prejudice of all his officers.&nbsp; For they thinking <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>at first,
that his proceeding came from the love of justice, and good
order, came all to <i>Rome</i> with instructions and memorials,
wherein their wants and the necessities of their places were set
out: but all in vain; for when they expected answer and
satisfaction, they found that the intention of the Pope was, to
refuse all, and to resolve nothing; so that then every one
avoided, not only the presence of the Pope, but <i>Rome</i> it
self, and all business in it.</p>
<p>This is the general disposition of the Court of <i>Rome</i>,
and of Church-men in common; though the Popes <i>Nephews</i> do
often give it another face, according as their designs and
thoughts are, which being as different as the humours of one Pope
from another; fortune, not merit, raising both Popes and Nephews
to this great command; we may say, that things in <i>Rome</i> are
rather performed by masked and counterfit persons, then by
natural ones: As one of my friends, who lives well, and is one of
the best Church-men in the Court of <i>Rome</i>, is used to say,
that when once he had put on the habit of a Priest, he could
hardly discern his own nature, nor know himself with comparison
to what he was before.&nbsp; Which shewes evidently, that
Church-men have certain close wayes of treating, particular to
themselves, that must make those that have to do with them, stand
upon their guard, and use all their policy.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> we must look back, and return
to <i>Sixtus</i> the 4th, who first opened a door to the
<i>Nipotismo</i>, and who by introducing his kindred, brought at
the same time ambition and riches into Rome; the riches were for
his Nephews, and the ambition he left as an inheritance to all
Church-men; and it is now one of the greatest mischiefs that
oppresseth the Church.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis not to be wondred at, that I begin the History of
the <i>Nipotismo</i>, from the time of <i>Sixtus</i> the fourth,
since he was the first that delivered up <i>Rome</i> and the
Popedom in prey to his Nephews, to the wonder and astonishment of
the whole world.</p>
<p>He was then the first introducer of the <i>Nipotismo</i>, and
so indulgent a one, that to favour his kindreds interest, he had
forgot himself, and the Church, thinking of nothing, but of the
means how to advance them to their satisfaction, from whence the
murmurs of the people were so great in <i>Rome</i>, that many
Confessors were fain to give <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>over their Function, that they might
not hear the peoples complaints against the Pope and his kindred:
So that it was spread through <i>Europe</i>, that <i>Rome</i> had
as many Popes as <i>Sixtus</i> had Nephews.</p>
<p>This Pope, immediately after his election, made two Cardinals;
<i>viz. Peter Riario</i>, whom many suspected to be his Bastard,
having alwayes been educated, with great care by him, in the same
Monastery; the other was <i>Julian</i>, son of <i>Raphad de la
Rovere</i>, brother to the Pope, and had been first Bishop of
<i>Carpentras</i>, then was made Cardinal by his Brother, and at
last came to be Pope, under the name of <i>Julius</i> the second,
as we shall relate in due place.</p>
<p><i>Sixtus</i> gave to the Cardinal, <i>Peter Riario</i>, all
that was in his power to give, adding Abby upon Abby, and revenue
upon revenue, till he had made him so rich in Church lands, that
he lived most splendidly, and seemed to be born to waste a
greater fortune; Plays, Balls, Dances, and such pastimes, were
the ornament which he bestowed upon his Ecclesiastical dignity,
being perswaded, that pomp and vanity were becoming the majesty
of a Cardinal.</p>
<p>He lived but two years in this loose life; in which time
&rsquo;tis thought he spent, in Treats, and Balls, and such like
diversions, above two hundred thousand Duckats of gold, besides
seventy thousand which he owed at his death, and which were never
payed: He dyed at the age of 28 years, to the great regret of his
Uncle, his disease having been caused by his debauchery, as the
Physitians testified.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Six
months before he dyed, the Pope, whose continual study it was,
how to make him great, declared and proclaim&rsquo;d him his
Legat over all <i>Italy</i>; not that any urgent business did
require such a Function, but only that he might give him an
occasion of shewing his Grandeur, and receiving more pleasure in
those triumphs and receptions, he was upon this score to have
bestowed upon him by the <i>Italian</i> Princes; who to humour
the Pope, forgot no honour they could think of, towards the
person of his Legat; and could not indeed have done more to the
Pope himself; particularly in <i>Venice</i>, <i>Milan</i>, and
<i>Padua</i>, he was received with so extraordinary a pomp, that
it was almost incredible.</p>
<p>Great was the delight which he took in these publick honours;
but much greater were the pleasures, which he tasted in secret,
having ordinarily, amongst his Attendants, five or six Russians,
whose business it was to satisfie his appetite, though never so
inordinate.&nbsp; Being at last come back to <i>Rome</i>, to the
possession of his old Mistresses, he ended his dayes amongst
them, and went to a new world, whether of pleasure or of pain,
God knows.</p>
<p>But the Popes affection to his kindred was not buryed in his
grave; for he made his Brother <i>Jerome</i> succeed in his
favour and fortune, which he rather increased then diminished;
for he made him Lord and Soveraign of <i>Inola</i> and
<i>Forli</i>; and gave him the government of all the state of the
Church, besides other important Offices.</p>
<p>This <i>Jerome</i> was a quite contrary disposition <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>to his
Brother; being naturally severe in words and deeds, and averse
from all pleasures but hunting.&nbsp; He married
<i>Catharina</i>, natural daughter to <i>Galeazzo</i>, Duke of
<i>Milan</i>; and <i>Sixtus</i> made <i>Ascanius</i>, the son of
the said Duke, Cardinal into the bargain, contrary to the young
mans inclination, which was rather to marriage, then to a single
life.</p>
<p>But the inordinate passion of this Pope did not rest in all
this; for his ambition of having kindred to advance was such,
that not being content with that great number of true Nephews
that he had, he substituted and adopted some, that were no
relation to him at all; to whom he gave an infinity of places and
commands.</p>
<p>He gave to <i>Leonard</i>, his brothers son, a natural
daughter of King <i>Ferdinand</i> in marriage, and made him
Prefect of <i>Rome</i>: And he being dead, he immediately
transferred that honour and place to another Nephew, called
<i>John de la Rovere</i>, brother to the Cardinal <i>Julian</i>;
giving him besides, the Propriety of the States of <i>Sora</i>
and <i>Sinigaglia</i>.</p>
<p>This <i>John</i> had by <i>Giovanna</i>, daughter to
<i>Frederick</i>, Duke of <i>Urbin</i>, a son, who was
<i>Francesco Maria della Rovere</i>, who after the death of
<i>Guido Ubaldo</i>, his Uncle, who dyed without male issue,
succeeded by adoption, and in the right of his Wife, to the
Dukedom of <i>Urbin</i>.</p>
<p>Besides these, <i>Sixtus</i> made Cardinals the two brothers,
<i>Christopher</i>, and <i>Dominic</i>, <i>de la Rovere</i>, who
lived in <i>Turin</i>, under the protection of the Duke of
<i>Savoy</i>, though they were Soveraigns of <i>Vico Nuovo</i>,
and other Estates in <i>Italy</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>Besides, he made <i>Jerome Batto</i>, his sisters Son,
Cardinal, as likewise <i>Raphael Samson</i>, son to a sister of
<i>Pictro Riario</i>, whom he promoted to that dignity, when he
was but seventeen years old, upon condition, that he should
change his name, and take that of the Popes Family.</p>
<p>This Pope had so much kindred, and was so inclined to advance
them, that he often granted the same thing to two different
persons, having forgot that he had granted it to the first.</p>
<p>But amongst all his inventions to enrich them, this was one of
the best: In the beginning of his Pontificat, he made, as if he
had a design to pay the debts, left upon the Church by the
precedent Popes, <i>Eugenius</i>, <i>Nicolas</i>,
<i>Calistus</i>, <i>Pius</i>, and <i>Paul</i>; but pretending
want of money to do it, he compassed his design by this
means.</p>
<p><i>Paul</i> the second, his predecessour, had alwayes had a
great inclination for the publick pomp and state of the Popedom,
and therefore strove to make the Ornaments of the Popes person
and head the richest that was possible for him; to which end, in
the Miter, which serves at their Coronation, and other publick
ceremonies, he had caused above the worth of a million in
precious stones to be set, having bought up (all the world over)
the best Diamonds, Saphires, Rubyes, Emeraulds, Chrysolites,
<i>&amp;c.</i> that could be had for money; so that afterwards,
when he came out in publick, he looked like another <i>Aaron</i>,
with a Majesty more divine then humane, being himself very tall,
and of a comely port and presence.</p>
<p><i>Sixtus</i>, who having been brought up in the <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>severity of a
Monastick life, did little esteem that outward pomp, which
<i>Paul</i>, his predecessour, so much prized, caused these
precious Stones to be sold, under pretence of discharging such
debts, as the Church was lyable to for his predecessours.</p>
<p>The Jewels were soon sold, and the money consigned into the
hands of his Nephews; but the debts were never payed, though the
Jewels had been sold to that end: And that which is worth
relating is, that the Pope answered every one, that came to
demand any thing due to them; that he had already payed the
others, that he was sorry it was not their fortune to come
sooner, and that the money had proved short to discharge so many
debts: So that the poor Creditors were fain to go away cheated,
and yet knew not whom to complain of.</p>
<p>The <i>Romans</i> murmured strangely, against this greediness
of the Pope and his kindred, and so much the more, because that
they had not yet been accustomed to see a Popes passion; for his
kindred make him rob and plunder the Church.&nbsp; They wondred
what example <i>Sixtus</i> could have for his proceedings, for
none of his predecessours had hitherto shewed so little
moderation, but in providing for their kindred, had kept some
measures.&nbsp; Neither could his education furnish him with this
ambition and covetousness; for he had been brought up in a
Convent, amongst Religious persons, who professed voluntary
poverty, and to whose principles he seemed to be so inured, as
not to be able to forsake them: for all the while he managed
publick business, before he was a Cardinal, <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>it was with a
great deal of candour and disinteressment that he did it; and
when he came to be made Cardinal, he was so far from keeping a
Court, and living in that splendour, which others thought became
that dignity, that his family and Retinue looked rather like a
Convent, then like a train of Attendants.&nbsp; But as soon as he
was Pope, he changed of a sudden, and lived like a Prince, never
troubling himself at what the world said of him, but cared only
to please himself, and make his kindred great.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Sixtus</i> being dead, <i>Innocentius</i> the eighth was
made Pope, in the year 1484. being of the noble Family of
<i>Cibo</i>, which hath had many eminent persons in it.&nbsp;
This Pope, remembring the complaints of the <i>Romans</i> against
his predecessour, for being too indulgent to his kindred,
resolved to be very cautious in that point, and give no occasion
of scandal that way: Which he observed so well, that when any one
of his kindred came to <i>Rome</i>, and that he had notice of it,
he would say, <i>Our kindred had much better stay in</i> Geneva
<i>without us</i>, <i>then come to</i> Rome <i>for our sakes</i>;
and indeed he was very reserved to them: For to <i>Mauritius
Cibo</i>, who was a very accomplish&rsquo;d Gentleman, he gave
nothing, but the Government of the Dutchy <i>Spoleto</i>, and
made him President of the State of the Church Employments, which
in those dayes were not of any great honour or profit, though now
they are both rich and honourable.</p>
<p>So he made <i>Lawrens Cibo</i>, his Nephew, Cardinal, but with
very little authority, forbidding him <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>to meddle with publick business of
importance, without being called to it.&nbsp; And yet was he
forced, as it were, to honour him thus far; for many whispering
about the Court, that he was a Bastard, he was fain to shew the
world, that he did own him, as being lawfully born of one of his
Cozens; which he proved by a process and strict examination
before Cardinal <i>Balbo</i>, a <i>Venetian</i>, and one, who had
no wayes interest to favour the family of <i>Cibo</i>.</p>
<p>The greatest advantage that this Pope procured his Family,
was, that he married <i>Francesco Cibo</i> with <i>Magdalen</i>
of <i>Medicis</i>, sister of <i>Leo</i> the tenth that was
afterwards, giving him the County of <i>Anguillara</i>, which was
not of any importance in those dayes, and making him Captain
General of the Forces of the Church: And in this he ended all the
favours that he ever shewed his Family, which was very noble
besides.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Alexander</i> the sixth succeeded <i>Innocentius</i> in the
Popedom, who was a barbarous, lascivious Pope, making no
difficulty of bringing desolation upon the Church, and imbrewing
his hands in innocent bloud, to advance and make great his
kindred.&nbsp; In the reign of this Pope, the <i>Romans</i> used
to say, <i>That the Emperours had taught tyranny</i>, <i>and the
Popes practised it</i>.</p>
<p>He was cruel, covetous, and insatiable, in heaping riches
together: He spent his retired hours all in lascivious pleasures,
taking great delight to be embraced and caress&rsquo;d by fair
Ladies; whence the numbers of his Bastards was very great; many
taking from thence occasion to say, <i>That he </i><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span><i>had
filled</i> Rome <i>with Bastards</i>, <i>and</i> Spain <i>with
Whores</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, that he declared for his Heirs
only, four male children, and two female: And though he used to
change Ladies often, for variety and greater pleasure, yet he
gave himself up to <i>Vanoccia</i>, a Roman Curtizan, whom he
loved as his lawful Wife, and with whom he would sport and toy in
publick, keeping her at his table, and in his house, as if she
had been his true Wife, and this while he was Archbishop and
Cardinal.</p>
<p>Being made Pope, in the year 1492. the second of
<i>August</i>, he introduced into <i>Rome</i>, not a
<i>Nipotismo</i>, but rather a <i>Filiolismo</i>, nay indeed, a
<i>Bastardismo</i>, that is, a company of Bastards, whom he
brought with him, in his return from his Legation in
<i>Spain</i>: And his first way to make him great was, by force
of Arms, making league with this Prince, then with that, then
with another, but still upon these conditions, to give
Principalities, which he nam&rsquo;d, to his bastard sons.</p>
<p>For this end, he joyned in a Confederacy, which proved fatal
to all <i>Italy</i>, with <i>Lewis</i> the twelfth of
<i>France</i>, with the Catholick King, the <i>Venetians</i>, and
the <i>Florentines</i>; the Conditions of which League were, that
they should dispossess the true and ancient Owners of the
Provinces of <i>La Romagna</i>, <i>La Marca</i>, and
<i>Umbria</i>; and that the whole should be made over to <i>Cesar
Borgia</i>, the Popes son; who to this end had laid aside his
Cardinals Cap, and taken in marriage <i>Charlotte</i> of
<i>Albret</i>, daughter to the King of <i>Navarre</i>, and allyed
to the French King, and divers other great Princes.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>But
this design having taken no effect, because of the dispute, that
rise between the <i>French</i> and the <i>Spaniard</i>, about the
dividing of the Kingdom of <i>Naples</i>, which at last ended in
the utter ruine of the <i>French</i>, the <i>Spaniards</i>
remaining Masters of the whole Kingdom; the Pope thought it was
easier for him to compass his ends, and establish the Grandeur of
his Bastards by great and powerful Alliances.</p>
<p>From hence proceeded, that having promised his daughter
<i>Lucretia</i>, while he was Cardinal, to a certain
<i>Spaniard</i>; as soon as he was Pope, he took her away from
him, and bestow&rsquo;d her in marriage upon <i>John Sforza</i>,
Lord of <i>Pesaro</i>, with whom being also fallen out, he took
her away from him, and bestowed her upon <i>Lewis</i> of
<i>Arragon</i>, natural son to King <i>Alfonse</i>; joyning thus
two bastards, that they might not reproach one another: And he
likewise dying some months after his marriage, he gave her to
<i>Alfonse d&rsquo;Este</i>, Duke of <i>Ferrare</i>, with whom
she lived and dyed.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas in the pomp of her Wedding,
that the Pope caused to be celebrated in <i>Rome</i>, Turnaments
and Tiltings, together with the representation of a hunting
Match; and many say, that in the Ball and Dances the Pope danced
every night, masked, with some of his intimate Friends.</p>
<p>Of his sons, he made <i>Godfrey</i>, the youngest Prince of
<i>Squillace</i>, a City in <i>Ulterior Calabria</i>, and the
Country of Saint <i>Cassiodorus</i>: He made <i>Cesar</i>, who
was the second, Cardinal; and his eldest, named <i>John</i>, was
by the great entreaties and instances of the Pope, made Duke of
<i>Candia</i> <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>in<i> Spain</i>, much against the inclination of the
Catholick King; for this <i>John</i> he procured in marriage a
bastard daughter of <i>Alfonse</i>, King of <i>Naples</i>; and
thus he filled the <i>Vatican</i> with bastards, whereupon
<i>Pasquin</i>, with a great deal of reason, call&rsquo;d it,
<i>Il Bastardismo</i>.</p>
<p><i>Cesar</i>, his second son, being troubled to see his
brother <i>John</i> above him, and more beloved by his Father,
resolved to take him out of the way; so one night, as <i>John</i>
was going in <i>Rome</i> about some business, he caused him to be
set upon by some of his Confidents, who having stabb&rsquo;d him,
cast him half alive headlong into the <i>Tyber</i>; and the same
evening (a barbarous action) they had supped together, very
brotherly, at their Mother <i>Vanoccias</i> house.</p>
<p>The Pope, who was afraid of incurring the same danger from his
son, whose temper he knew to be wicked enough for such an
undertaking, was forced to dissemble this inhumane action of the
Cardinal, and to make no pursuits nor informations about the
death of his eldest son.</p>
<p><i>Cesar</i>, being thus delivered of his brother, began to
give himself up to the life of a Souldier, and the practise of
Arms, without any consideration of his being a Cardinal: for his
great motive in murdering his brother was, that he might attain
to the dignity of <i>Gonfalonier</i>, or Standard-bearer of the
Church, and Captain General of the Popes Armies; so that a little
after his Fratricide, he layed off his Cardinals Habit, and the
Pope invested him with all the honours of his dead brother.</p>
<p>Thus being made General of the Popes Army, <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>he united
with the <i>French</i>, and married <i>Charlotte</i> of
<i>Albret</i>, and had for her portion the Dutchy of
<i>Valenza</i>, from whence he was called over, after Duke
<i>Valentine</i>, as being a particular acquisition of his
own.</p>
<p>With the help of <i>Lewis</i> the twelfth, and of his Father
the Pope, he gained a great estate in <i>Italy</i>; his Father
being still ready to supply him with vast sums of money, which he
spent to purchase greatness.</p>
<p>Having driven the Family of the <i>Sforza&rsquo;s</i> out of
<i>Milan</i>, and put them in prison; by the help of the
<i>French</i> King, he made himself Master, with great cruelty,
of all the Cities of <i>La Romagna</i>, except <i>Bologna</i>,
banishing and murdering the ancient and true Lords and Masters of
them.</p>
<p>The first seized upon <i>Forli</i> and <i>Imola</i>, causing
the poor young <i>Riarri</i>, who were Lords of those places, to
fly for safety; and taking prisoner their Mother
<i>Catharine</i>, whom he carried in triumph to <i>Rome</i>;
exposing to the eyes of the <i>Romans</i> his barbarous
cruelties.</p>
<p>From <i>Forli</i> he passed to <i>Faenza</i>, which City he
took by force, putting to death <i>Astorre Manfredi</i>, who was
Lord of it.</p>
<p>He did the same by <i>Arimino</i> and <i>Pesaro</i>, forcing
<i>Nulatesta</i>, and <i>John Sforza</i>, to avoid by flight, the
infamy and cruelty of the death they were sure to undergo, if
they fell into his hands.</p>
<p>After this, he besieged <i>Sinigaglia</i>, and took it by
force, committing infinite acts of inhumanity in it.</p>
<p>With the same course of Victory, though with <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>craft and
deceit mingled with force, he deprived <i>Guido Ubaldo di
Feltro</i> of his Dutchy of <i>Urbin</i>, making him fly to
<i>Mantua</i>, not without danger of falling into his net by the
way.</p>
<p>After this, he lead his Army against the City of
<i>Camerino</i>, which he took by force, and put to a cruel death
<i>Giulio Cesare</i>, and <i>Venantio Varrani</i>, who were, and
had been, long in possession of it.&nbsp; And with the same
ardour and ambition, he fell to persecuting all the neighbouring
Princes, in hopes to deprive them of their States.</p>
<p>At last, he turned his rage upon the chiefest Families of
<i>Rome</i>, beginning with the noble Family of the
<i>Gaetani</i>, who were in possession of great Estates in the
Country of the <i>Volai</i>, putting to death <i>Honorato</i> and
<i>Cola Gaetani</i>.</p>
<p>Next, he fell upon the <i>Colonna&rsquo;s</i> Family, and
having dispossessed them of their Lands, forced them to fly to
<i>Apulia</i>, and <i>Sicily</i>, where they were extremely
pitied by that people, who had a perfect knowledge of their rare
deserts.</p>
<p>But while he thought to do the same to the <i>Ursins</i>, they
having leagued themselves with other Princes, raised an Army in
their defence; and having at last encountred his, defeated it,
and forced him to fly to <i>Imola</i>, or, as some say, to
<i>Rome</i>, where the Pope, being frightned with this sudden
blow, had recourse to craft and dissimulation; he treats with the
Confederates; gives them such Conditions, that they themselves,
even triumphant, could hardly expect: And having thus
lull&rsquo;d them asleep, and made them lay down Armes; in the
mean while, <i>Borgia</i> having recovered himself, and got a new
Army, fell upon <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>them most cruelly; and persecuting them separately, put
to death some, banish&rsquo;d others; and in a word, used all
barbarous means to compass their ruine.</p>
<p>All this while the Pope was taking his delight in the
<i>Vatican</i>, in <i>Vanoccia&rsquo;s</i> armes; receiving every
day, with new joy and satisfaction, the news of his Sons
crimes.</p>
<p>The Revenue of the Church being not sufficient to maintain
such an Army as <i>Cesar Borgia&rsquo;s</i> was, and withall, to
supply the expence of his Court, which was truly Royal and
Prince-like; <i>Alexander</i> made a new Colledge of fourscore
Writers of Briefs, selling every place for two hundred and fifty
Crowns of Gold; receiving besides into <i>Rome</i> those
<i>Moors</i>, that the King of <i>Spain</i> had driven out of his
Dominions, who to enjoy their liberty, gave him great sums of
money: And yet all this seeming inconsiderable, he sold divers
Cardinals Caps, and at last, for fear of being unprovided of
money in some urgent necessity, he resolved to dispatch with
poyson, the richest Prelates of the Court, and amongst them some
very rich Cardinals, whose Estates he intended to make himself
heir to, and so satiate the barbarous greediness of his son.</p>
<p>But Divine Providence, taking compassion of the innocency of
so many persons, disappointed this barbarous design most
miraculously; for just in the execution of it, the Pope himself
was, by the mistake of his Cup-bearer, sent out of the World, and
his son <i>Cesar</i> in extreme danger: And thus it happened.</p>
<p><i>Alexander</i> invited to a Treat, in his Garden <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>of
<i>Belocdere</i>, all the richest Cardinals and Prelates, under
pretence of honouring them; and had secretly given order to
mingle some poyson with most exquisite Wines that they were to
drink.&nbsp; But the Cup-bearer, in pouring out his Wine into
Glasses, mistook, and poysoned the Pope and his Son
<i>Cesar</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, that some do believe, that
the Cup-bearer did it on purpose, being glad to be the
Instrument, that should deliver the State and Church from so much
misery, in which they were involved under this Popes tyranny.</p>
<p><i>Cesar</i> perceiving himself to be poysoned, presently had
recourse to Remedies, and with vomiting, being strong, and in the
flower of his age, freed himself from the poyson, though very
violent: &rsquo;Tis true, that he remained impotent, and unfit
for action, so that his Army immediately crumbled away, for want
of his personal assistance to keep them together.</p>
<p>But the Pope, who was already seventy two years old, was not
able to resist the strength of the poyson, though all the
Remedies imaginable, were put in use to save him.&nbsp; So he
dyed in the <i>Vatican</i>, in the year one thousand five hundred
and three.</p>
<p>As soon as the Pope was dead, <i>Cesar</i>, his son, caused
himself, and all the Popes Treasure, to be transported to the
<i>Vatican</i>, under the guard of twelve thousand Souldiers,
with an intention, to force the Cardinals to make a Pope of his
liking: But he failed in his design; for the Cardinals met in the
Convent of <i>La Minerva</i>: And <i>Cesar</i> having set
<i>Michrelletto Correglia</i>, his great Captain, <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>to besiege
them, the people of <i>Rome</i>, moved with indignation against
such a violence offered to the Cardinals, rose in Armes for their
defence; whereupon <i>Borgia</i> resolved to retire to
<i>Nepe</i> with his Army, and leave the Cardinals their liberty:
Who being free, and having celebrated the Popes Obsequies, went
into the Conclave to choose his Successor; and after some
dispute, agreed in the Person of Cardinal <i>Picolomini</i>, one
of the eminentest Prelates of the Court, who took the name of
<i>Pius</i> the third.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The news of this Election being come to <i>Siena</i>, which
was the Popes native Country, <i>Pandolfo Petrucci</i>, who was
Tyrant of this City, was extremely troubled at it, doubting not,
but that the Pope would soon drive him away, and set his Country
at liberty; so that to be rid of his fear, he procur&rsquo;d a
Chirurgion to poyson a Sore that the Pope had in one of his Legs;
which was done, and the poor Pope dyed, some seven and twenty
dayes after his creation.</p>
<p>The <i>Picolomini</i> Nephews and Relations to his Holiness,
were already flown to <i>Rome</i>, like so many Bees, but before
they could get within the gates, they receiv&rsquo;d the sad news
of their Uncles death; so that they were fain to return to
<i>Siena</i> upon the same Horses, upon which they came to
<i>Rome</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas certainly believed, that this Pope
would have made another <i>Nipotismo</i> in <i>Rome</i>, for he
was very tender hearted and kind to his kindred.</p>
<p>To <i>Pius</i> succeeded <i>Jules</i>, the second brother to
<i>Sixtus</i> the fourth, who was chosen with so publick <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>a consent and
applause, that he was almost proclaim&rsquo;d Pope before he went
into the Conclave; the people receiv&rsquo;d the news of his
Election, with extraordinary demonstration of joy, because of the
great esteem they had for his person, <i>Alexander</i> having
kept him in banishment from <i>Rome</i>, for the space of ten
years together, to the displeasure of the whole Court of
<i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p><i>Jules</i> proved a man of a great Soul, and a noble and
constant Defender of the Church, and little inclin&rsquo;d to
make his kindred great.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, he did own a great
deal of kindness for his Relations, but much more for the Church:
And did say, <i>That he would have bestowed upon them all that he
had</i>, <i>if all that he had were not the Churches</i>.&nbsp;
Therefore he would never give them any State belonging to the
Church; and if <i>Francesco Maria</i>, his brothers son, did
obtain the Dutchy of <i>Urbin</i>, it was, because that <i>Guido
Ubaldo da Feltra</i>, his Kinsman, did adopt him.&nbsp; Some say,
that it was by the Popes perswasions, that <i>Guido Ubaldo</i>
did this; which though it were true, yet it did not any wayes
prejudice the Church: And if he did bestow <i>Pesaro</i> on the
same <i>Francesco Maria</i>, which State was lately fallen to the
Church by the death of <i>Gio. Sforza</i>, who dyed without
Heirs, it was to pay to the said <i>Francesco Maria</i> certain
debts, which he pretended due to him from the Church.</p>
<p>Besides, he never gave any extraordinary Authority to four
Cardinals of his own kindred and creating; who were very much
displeased and discontented at this his severity.</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>He
answered one day two of his Relations, who were very pressing for
an Office, which he would not grant; <i>You ought to be content
with what my Brother did</i>, <i>who lov&rsquo;d the house of</i>
La Rovere <i>better then the Church</i>.</p>
<p>In his time Rome was almost without a <i>Nipotismo</i>: but no
sooner was <i>Leo</i> the tenth raised to this great honour, but
things began to run in another stream; for this Pope, though
otherwise very worthy of such an Elevation, yet was he no sooner
settled in his Dignity, but he began to project the greatness and
advancement of the house of the <i>Medicis</i>.&nbsp; And first
he bestowed upon <i>Julian</i>, his Brother, the Office of
<i>Gonfaloniero</i>, or Standard-bearer to the Church, together
with other charges and places: Then he called most of his kindred
to <i>Rome</i>, making them Cardinals, and bestowing Dignities
upon them.&nbsp; So that the <i>Nipotismo</i> began to take a new
possession of <i>Rome</i> and the Church.</p>
<p><i>Leo</i> undertook, by the means of the Emperour
<i>Maximilian</i>, to make his brother <i>Julian</i> Lord of
<i>Siena</i> and <i>Lucca</i>, pretending to add to his
Domination the Dutchies of <i>Urbino</i> and <i>Ferrara</i>: But
<i>Julian</i> dying in the interim, the Pope transferred his
kindness upon his brother <i>Lawrens</i>, and attempted the
execution of this his design in his favour, by the means of the
Emperour <i>Charles</i> the fifth, who was newly come to the
Empire.&nbsp; Besides, he put into his hands the government of
the City of <i>Florence</i>, with this condition, that he should
undertake nothing, without the advice and consent of the
Citizens.</p>
<p>Then he enriched him with all the Honours <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>and Offices
his brother had enjoyed in the Church-State; and yet desirous
every day to make him greater, and to satisfie the instant
prayers of his Mother <i>Alfonsina</i>.&nbsp; He made war with
<i>Francesco Maria della Rovere</i>, Duke of <i>Urbin</i>; and
having sent an Army against him, under the command of <i>Renzo di
Lere</i>, he took his Dutchy from him, and invested with the
title of Duke of <i>Urbin Lawrens</i> his Nephew; the poor Duke
and his Lady being constrained to fly to <i>Mantua</i> for
refuge.</p>
<p>With the same intention, though not with the same success, he
strove to pick a quarrel with <i>Alfonse</i>, Duke of
<i>Ferrara</i>; but he being a Prince experienced in war, and
under the protection of a strong City, easily defeated the Popes
design and artifices.</p>
<p><i>Lawrens</i> being dead, the Pope sent the Cardinal of
<i>Medicis</i> to <i>Florence</i>, to govern that City; and in
him first began to relent that great ardour, with which he had
hitherto pursued the advancement of his Family, giving himself
over to other Employments, much more necessary, and more becoming
a Prelate, whose care was not only to be bounded within the walls
of <i>Rome</i>, but over all <i>Christendome</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Adrian</i> the sixth was <i>Leo&rsquo;s</i> Successour, he
had been the Emperour <i>Charles</i> the fifth his Tutor, and was
created Pope the year of our Lord 1529. being then in
<i>Victoria</i>, a City of <i>Spain</i>: As soon as he received
the news of his Election, he embarqued at <i>Terracona</i>, and
came to <i>Genoa</i>; where having received the Complements of
Ambassadours <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>of all parts, he came in great triumph to
<i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>This Pope was indeed too severe with his kindred; and under
him, the Court of <i>Rome</i> pass&rsquo;d from one extremity to
another: for his Predecessours gave all to their Nephews, and he
refus&rsquo;d to give them even that which they deserved; and for
this reason he was blam&rsquo;d, not only by the Court, and
forraign Ambassadours, but also by the common people, as being
unnatural and clownish.</p>
<p>There was in <i>Siena</i> one of his Cozens sons, maintained
there in his studies by the Pope; who being moved with the
ambition of rising under his Uncles Pontificat, came to
<i>Rome</i> without order; but the Pope no sooner had notice of
it, but he commanded (without being prevail&rsquo;d upon to see
him) that he should instantly be carried back again upon a
hackney Horse; giving order to his Confessor, to tutor him
sharply for being so bold; and bidding him remember to take from
his Uncle, an example of modesty and temperance, and apply
himself strongly to his study, and the practise of vertue, which
would advance him without help of his kindred, or at least very
little.</p>
<p>Many others of his kindred, even his Nephews, came from
<i>Germany</i> to <i>Rome</i>, with a design to enrich their
fortunes, as other Popes Relations had done; but they soon found
they had abus&rsquo;d themselves, for the Pope, angry at their
journey, sent them all back, with no other Present, then each of
them a woollen Sute, and just as much money as would suffice to
bear their <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>charges.&nbsp; Nay, even to one, who out of necessity
was come a foot, he refused to give any more then would just
defray his expences on foot back again.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true,
that some Cardinals were very Noble to them.&nbsp; This Pope was
continually blaming the Prodigality of those who had bestowed
such great riches upon the Church.&nbsp; In the year that this
Pope liv&rsquo;d, <i>Rome</i> was so afflicted and visited with
Warre, Famine, and Plague, that it cannot be remembred without
tears, and the people very unjustly laid all the fault upon the
Pope, all mouths being open to clamour against him, and sing the
Latin Verse:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>Semper de Sextis
diruta Roma fuit</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To <i>Adrian</i> succeeded <i>Clement</i> the Seventh of the
Family of the <i>Medici</i>, who conserving the wonted ambition
of this Family encreased their revenues and power with all his
industry, insomuch that after he had been imprison&rsquo;d and
extraordinarily ill us&rsquo;d by the Emperour <i>Charles</i> the
Fifth, he nevertheless entred into a confederacy with him, upon
condition that he should give his bastard Daughter
<i>Margaret</i> in Marriage to <i>Alexander</i> of <i>Medici</i>,
<i>Lawrens</i> his Son, and by force of Arms oblige the
<i>Florentines</i> to acknowledge him for their Lawful
Prince.&nbsp; All this was accordingly executed, the Emperor
having sent the Prince of <i>Orange</i> with a very great Army to
settle the <i>Medici</i> in their new principality.</p>
<p>And <i>Clement</i> not content with this; as soon as the
Emperour was gone into <i>Spain</i>, made a new league with
<i>Francis</i> the First of <i>France</i>, and <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>to strengthen
it, <i>Henry</i> the Second, the Daulphin of <i>France</i>,
married <i>Catharina</i> of <i>Medicis</i> Daughter to
<i>Laurens</i>; the wedding was kept at <i>Marseillis</i>, where
the King and the Pope were both present.</p>
<p>The Pope having thus happily setled his family, returned to
<i>Rome</i>, and there died: In <i>September</i> 1534. and in the
same year, in the Month of <i>October</i>, <i>Paul</i> the Third
was chosen to fill his place, with great joy and applause of the
people of <i>Rome</i>.&nbsp; He was <i>Alexander Farnese</i>
Cardinal, and one who shewed himself worthy of so eminent a
dignity.</p>
<p>His first work was to find out means to advance his Family;
and therefore in <i>December</i> following he created two of his
Nephews Cardinals; one <i>Alexander Fernese</i>, Son to <i>Pietro
luigi Farnese</i> his own Son, for the Pope had been married
before he was Cardinal; and the other <i>Guido ascanso Forza
Costanza</i> his daughters Son.&nbsp; <i>Alexander</i> being
suddenly dead, the Cardinal <i>Hippolito Medici</i> was made
Vice-Chancellour of the Church, and Vice-Chamberlain after the
death of Cardinal <i>Spinola</i>.&nbsp; Thus from day to day, as
places and offices became vacant, the Popes Nephews were sure to
have them.</p>
<p><i>Paul</i> was very desirous to procure a meeting between the
Emperour and the King of <i>France</i>, where he desir&rsquo;d to
be present in person also; which thing being carried on by his
Legat, Cardinal <i>Carpi</i> was well accepted and agreed of by
both <i>Princes</i>, the Town of <i>Nizza</i> in <i>Provence</i>,
but belonging to the Duke of <i>Savoy</i>: was chosen for the
place of meeting, as being conveniently situated upon the Sea
side.</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>The
Pope, though old, was the first that came to the place appointed,
having endured very great inconveniencies in his journey; and yet
he was disappointed at last of his desires; for these two Princes
having penetrated into the Popes design, found that it was not
out of any love to Christendome, but only out of a fond affection
to his family that he had desir&rsquo;d their company.&nbsp; So
they refused to see one another in his presence, but came
separatly, and kiss&rsquo;d the Popes feet with no small
mortification to his Holiness, being thus deluded and almost
derided.</p>
<p>And indeed this interparly was not desired nor procur&rsquo;d
by the Pope, either with a design of appeasing the differences in
Religion, or of making a League betwixt the Christian Princes
against the Turk, though this were the pretext, but with a
purpose to get <i>Margaret</i> of <i>Austria</i>, the widdow of
<i>Alexander Medici</i>, for <i>Octavio Farneze</i> his
Grandchild; and following the example of <i>Clement</i> the
Seventh, give <i>Victoria</i>, afterwards married to <i>Guido
Ubaldo</i> Duke of <i>Urbin</i>, his Neece, to some Prince of the
blood of <i>France</i>, having chosen out the Duke of
<i>Vendosme</i>, who was a young Prince of great merit and hopes:
but for this time the Pope was forced to return to <i>Rome</i>
without having effected his designs, as the King of <i>France</i>
went to his own Kingdome, and the Emperour to <i>Marseilles</i>,
where he visited the <i>French</i> King.</p>
<p>Some time after the Pope obtained from the Emperour the City
of <i>Novarre</i> for his Son <i>Pietro Luigi</i>, and made up
the match between his Grandchild <i>Octavio</i> and the Princess
<i>Margaret</i> <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>Daughter to the Emperour, and widdow of <i>Alexander
Medici</i>; this done, the Pope undertook the recovery of the
City of <i>Lamerino</i>, which he pretended to be devoted to the
Church by the death of <i>Giovani Maria Varrano</i>, who had
receiv&rsquo;d the investiture of that place from <i>Leo</i> the
Tenth, and dyed without any male children, and upon this Title
made warre against the young <i>Guido Ubaldo da Feltro</i>, who
by the Womens side pretended a right to it, but not being able to
maintain it, was fain to fly and leave the place to the Pope, who
having taken it, presently gave the investiture to his
Grand-child <i>Octavio Farneze</i>, making him Duke of
<i>Camerino</i>, and Receivour General of the Church, having
before made him Prefect of <i>Rome</i> in the place of the Duke
of <i>Urbin</i>.</p>
<p>But this Popes ambition swell&rsquo;d much higher, for he went
about to buy the Dutchy of <i>Millan</i> of the Emperour with the
Churches money, and make an unalienable Patrimony of the Family
of the <i>Farnezes</i>.&nbsp; But the Emperour, though very
necessitous and extreamly sollicited by the Pope with a vast
summe of ready mony, was nevertheless so prudent as not to
dismember from his Empire so considerable a part of it.</p>
<p>Besides this the Pope gave to his Son <i>Pietro Luigi</i>,
against the consent of almost all the Cardinals, the noble Cities
of <i>Parma</i> and <i>Placentia</i> in <i>Lombardy</i>, which
were Fiefs of the Church.&nbsp; The said <i>Pietro Luigi</i> was
murdered by the principal Citizens of <i>Placentia</i> in a
conjuration layed and carried on by the Emperours order; who all
along refused to confirm <i>Pietro Luigi</i> in this new
Principality, the Pope pretending that the Emperour <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>should
acknowledge him for lawful Lord and Master of these Cities; which
he was so far from doing, that he endeavour&rsquo;d to take them
from him; whereupon the Pope was forced, that he might support
his Son, to side with the <i>French</i>, who failed not to settle
his Grand-child <i>Octavio</i>, though with this condition that
he should renounce <i>Camerino</i>, and restore it to the Church,
and be content with <i>Parma</i> and <i>Placentia</i>, for which
he should pay every year seven thousand Crowns to the Apostolick
Chamber.</p>
<p>Thus the Nipotismo was in great credit and Authority in
<i>Pauls</i> time: for this Pope spared nothing to make them
great, alienating the Churches Lands, and maintaining them in the
possession of their acquisitions with the Churches Mony, which
stirr&rsquo;d the indignation of all Christendome, and made the
Hereticks, who by this time were multiplied like Grashoppers,
take from them an occasion to deny the Popes authority and
primacy.</p>
<p><i>Julius</i> the third, who succeeded <i>Paul</i>,
preserv&rsquo;d his Nipotismo in a handsome condition and rank,
but was not so furiously transported with Ambition to settle them
in Dukedomes and Principalities.&nbsp; His humour was gay and
merry, a good companion, and one that lov&rsquo;d to eat and
drink well with his friends.</p>
<p>And yet though this jovial inclination of his made him little
enclin&rsquo;d to warlike attempts, he nevertheless sent great
Succours to the Duke of <i>Florence</i>, <i>Cosino</i>, in his
Warre against the <i>Sienezes</i>: and this because the said Duke
had promis&rsquo;d him to make his Brother <i>Baldwin</i> Marquis
of <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span><i>Monte san Sabino</i>; which thing was not only
executed, but besides, the Dukes Daughter was promised in
Marriage to <i>Fabian de monti Baldovin</i> his Son; she was
afterwards married to <i>Alfonse</i> Duke of <i>Ferrara</i>.</p>
<p><i>Giulio</i> made also five of his Nephews Cardinals, to wit,
<i>Christopher di Monte</i>, <i>Fulvio de la Corgna</i>,
<i>Innocentia de Monte</i>, <i>Geronimo Simoncello</i>, and
<i>Roberto de Monte pulcrano</i>.&nbsp; To these he was very
liberal, but to say true, not prodigal, as his Predecessors had
been.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, he did what he could, to make his
Brother <i>Baldwin</i> Duke of <i>Camerino</i>, and deprive the
Church of so good a State, but the Cardinals oppos&rsquo;d him so
vigorously, that he was fain to desist from his design.</p>
<p><i>Julius</i> being dead, the very name of the Nipotismo dyed
with him, for in the year 1555 <i>Marcelius</i> the Second was
made Pope; who would never endure, that any of his kindred should
come neer <i>Rome</i>, no not his own Brother.&nbsp; Nay more, he
would never suffer that two Nephewes of his, who before his
Election liv&rsquo;d with him, following their Studies in
<i>Rome</i> under his care, should receive any visits as his
Nephews; and he forbid him to stir out of doors, least in going
to School they should be owned in the streets, and receive the
Complements of persons of quality.</p>
<p>They that knew much of his mind while he was Cardinal, said
after his death, That his intention was altogether bent to apply
some remedy to the ambition of the Popes; and that he had
particularly resolved to give to his Brother and Kindred but just
as much as would maintain them like ordinary Gentlemen; but not
so much as a simple <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>Barony, much less Dukedomes and Principalities; and to
this he would have the advice and consent of the whole Colledge
of Cardinals, having a firme purpose of making most secure
decrees, by which the Popes should be bound, and kindred from
giving any thing to their Kindred without the consent of all the
Cardinals.</p>
<p>But while he was intent upon so good a work, he was surprized
by death twenty dayes after his election; so that in so short a
time he did neither good nor harme to the Church.</p>
<p>To him succeeded <i>Paul</i> the Fourth, of the House and
Family of <i>Caraffa</i> in the same year 1555.&nbsp; This Pope
was one of the most fantasticall ill humour&rsquo;d men that all
the World could afford.&nbsp; He presently made his Brothers Son
<i>Carlo Caraffa</i> Cardinal; and to him he gave so much
Authority, that it seemed that the Popes Will depended upon his
pleasure.&nbsp; He excommunicated <i>Mark Antonia Colomna</i>,
<i>and Ascanio</i> his Son, under divers pretexts, but indeed
only to take from them those offices and honours which they had
in <i>Rome</i>, and to seize upon all their Revenues within the
Territories of the Church; which was severely executed; the Pope
at the same time giving the investiture of all their estates to
<i>Giovani</i>, Count of <i>Montorio</i> his Brothers Son, giving
him the Title of Duke of <i>Paliano</i>, which place he
immediatly went about to fortifie, that it might hold out against
the forces the Colonesses were raising to recover their lands, as
at last they did.</p>
<p>A little after he made <i>Antonio Caraffa</i> the Earles
brother, Marquess of <i>Montebello</i>, a place <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>which he had
deprived the right owner, the Earl of <i>Bagno</i>, of, as being
contumacious, and for having, as the Pope said, ingrossed that
money which the King of <i>France</i> had sent for the War in
<i>Italy</i>.</p>
<p>The Nephewes of this Pope became at last so insolent by their
Uncles indulgence, that they did rob, spoyl, ravish, kill, and in
a word commit all sorts of crimes with impunity; Exercising so
many cheats and frauds upon the poor people, that not only they
made all the World cry out against them, but at last moved the
indignation of their own Uncle, and provoked him to be severe to
them, driving them away out of <i>Rome</i>, and depriving them of
all honour and dignity.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Pius</i> the Fourth of <i>Milan</i>, of the Family of the
<i>Medici</i>, but of that branch that was then setled in
<i>Milan</i>, was chosen <i>Pauls</i> Successor; and no sooner
had he taken possession of the Popedome, but he fell to frame a
process and impeachment against the Nipotismo of his Predecessor,
with a design to punish them severely; which he executed, but
with an affront to the holy Character of a Pope, for he made as
if he had pardon&rsquo;d them all their misdemeanours, which he
confirmed with an Oath; to which the <i>Caraffas</i> trusting,
came to <i>Rome</i>, but no sooner were they there, but by the
Popes order, they were clap&rsquo;d up in prison, and having
undergone a new tryal, were all condemned to die.&nbsp; The
Cardinal <i>Carlo Caraffa</i> was strangled, the Earls of
<i>Montorio</i> and of <i>Alife</i>, and <i>Leonardo di
Cardine</i> were beheaded.&nbsp; Thus the City was as it were
purged of these abominations <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>which this Nipotismo had defiled it
with.</p>
<p>After this the good Pope <i>Pius</i>, that he might not come
short of the Piety of his Predecessors, introduced a new
Nipotismo; for above five and twenty Nephewes, brothers and
sisters children, came in upon him, of whom he refus&rsquo;d
none, but raised as high as it was possible for him to do, making
them all rich, and allying them with great families; but his
kindness did particularly extend to <i>Giovani Antonio
Sarbellone</i> his Nephew, who seemed to be born to heap riches
together.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But <i>Pius</i> the Fifth, who succeeded <i>Pius</i> the
Fourth, was not at all of this Humour, for he was absolutely
averse from any such unjust wayes of advancing his kindred,
having hardly condescended to make <i>Michael Bonello</i> his
Sisters son Cardinal; and certainly he had never done it, if all
the Cardinals unanimously had not raised in him a Scruple of
Conscience, by saying, That he refused to promote one who was
most worthy of that Honour.&nbsp; Therefore at last, and as it
were by force, he declar&rsquo;d him Cardinal, but with a strict
Order not to meddle with state affairs without Commission.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Gregory</i> the Thirteenth of the Family of the <i>Buon
Compagni</i>, who was chosen Pope after the death of <i>Pius</i>
in the year 1572. followed not so good a path, but declin&rsquo;d
to a great indulgence for his Relations.&nbsp; First, he
presently made <i>Philippo Buoncompagno</i> his Nephew Cardinal,
to whom he gave many Abbyes which were vacant in his Predecessors
time.</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Besides
he call&rsquo;d about him all his Nephewes, and Cozens, to whom
he gave Offices, Dignities, Governments and Lordships, enough to
make him great.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, he shewed no great
ambition of making them great Princes, because he saw little
posibility of a good success, but he heaped Abbies and Prelatures
upon them as many as they pleased.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>He dyed 1585 the tenth of <i>April</i>, and had for Successor
upon the 24th of the same Month <i>Sixtus</i> the Fifth of the
poor family of the <i>Peretti</i> having been a Monk of that
conventual Order, of which <i>Sixtus</i> the fourth who
lov&rsquo;d his kindred so well was.</p>
<p>In his first beginning he seem&rsquo;d a little averse from
his kindred, not that he despised them, but he shewed no desire
of making them Princes; but they that made any foundation upon
this exteriour were much deceiv&rsquo;d, for there never was a
Pope that had a greater love for his relations then this; and all
well considered, we shall find, that <i>Sixtus</i> the fifth gave
away much more to his Nipotismo, then <i>Sixtus</i> the Fourth;
for his Family of <i>La Rovere</i>, was very Noble, and
liv&rsquo;d splendidly before his assumption to the pontificat,
whereas the Family of <i>Peretti</i> was so poor, that they had
not bread to eat, being fain to beg here and there.</p>
<p>One of <i>Sixtus</i> the Fifth his Sisters was a Laundress in
<i>Escoli</i>, and come to see her Brother in <i>Rome</i> upon an
Ass, which was led by a Halter by her eldest Son, and with all
this he left him all rich and great.&nbsp; He lov&rsquo;d this
Sister of his <i>Camila</i> <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>most tenderly, insomuch that he could
never see her enough; and for her sake in the first month of his
Popedome, he made one of her Sons Cardinal, giving him his own
Cardinals Cap, and calling him by the name of Cardinal
<i>Moncealto</i>, though he was but one and twenty years
old.&nbsp; To him <i>Sixtus</i> gave in Abbyes and Church-lands
above five and thirty thousand Duckats a year, which was no small
revenue, in the hands of one, who lov&rsquo;d much to be
thrifty.</p>
<p>To the other brother, who had led the Asse, he gave the
chiefest offices and places of <i>Rome</i>, and married him with
great pomp and solemnity, to a rich Roman Lady.</p>
<p>He assigned 20 thousand Crowns a year to his said sister
<i>Camilla</i>, who drawing allwayes before her Eyes, her ancient
poor condition, could never be brought to lead a great Ladyes
life, but liv&rsquo;d allwayes like a country Woman.</p>
<p>Her two Daughters were both married, one to <i>Virginio
Urtino</i>, and the other to the high Constable of the Kingdome
of <i>Naples</i>; <i>Colonna</i>, to one of which he gave for
portion, a hundred thousand Crowns, and made a Cardinal of the
family of the <i>Colonna</i>, together with great Offices and
Revenues.</p>
<p>Besides this, he made <i>Alexander Beretto</i> his brothers
Son Cardinal, and assign&rsquo;d him a revenue of twenty thousand
Duckats in Offices within <i>Rome</i>, and in the Popes
Territories, in which he had great number of Benefices.</p>
<p>In a word, <i>Sixtus</i> when he dyed left to his Family the
sum of a hundred and fifty thousand Duckats yearly revenue,
besides money in specie, <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>and the wonder of this was, that it
was all done without any prejudice to the Church, but so much to
the contrary; for he surpassed in the stateliness of his edifices
in <i>Rome</i>, the ancient Romans, and yet left behind him five
millions of Crowns to the Church, to the astonishment of all
Christendome.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is little or nothing to be said of <i>Urban</i> the
seventh, who succeeded <i>Sixtus</i> in the year 1590, because he
liv&rsquo;d but 13 dayes after his election: But his kindred of
the house of <i>Castagna</i>, in <i>Genoa</i>, having suddenly
heard the news of his elevation, hastened to <i>Rome</i>; but
three dayes journey from <i>Genoa</i>, they receiv&rsquo;d the
newes of his death: Whereupon they were forced to return home,
and keep close for a great while, to avoyd the derision and
mocking of their Enemies.&nbsp; And this was, because that they
had gone out of the City in great pompe and state; beginning
allready to carry themselves like so many Princes: but their
pretensions vanishd with the Popes death.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Pope in so short a time shewed himself kind,
for he left them some considerable Legacies, having given away to
the company of the Nuntiata, whose Protector he had been, all
that was in his power to distribute.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But that which <i>Urban</i> could not compass in thirteen
dayes, <i>Gregory</i> the fourteenth his Successor did in ten
months.&nbsp; This Pope was of the family <i>Sfondrata</i> of
<i>Milan</i>, and very desirous of adding to the greatness of his
family.&nbsp; And because that <i>Paulo Emilio Sfondrato</i> was
at the time of his <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>creation in <i>Milan</i>, the Pope refus&rsquo;d to
dispatch any business before his coming to Rome, where presently
he was made Cardinal, and had twelve thousand Crowns a year
assigned him the same day, besides a great number of Abbies and
Offices which his Uncle gave him a little after.</p>
<p>The Pope was used to pass most part of his time with this
Cardinal; no business passing, but what was sifted between them;
the Pope often saying to him, Nephew, make a good purse before I
die: And the Nephew, who understood the means did not fail to
obey him, and out of every hundred take ninety for himself; the
rest he left to the Church, and that was alwayes the worst
money.</p>
<p>Two moneths after, he made the Count <i>Sfondrati</i>, another
of his Nephews, General of the holy Church, and sent him to the
Wars of <i>France</i>, having first married him with the daughter
of the Prince of <i>Massa</i>, and made him Duke of <i>Monte
Marciano</i>, which Dutchy the Pope pretended to be devolved to
the Church, ever since the death of <i>Alfonso Picolomini</i>,
Duke of the said place, whom the great Duke of Florence put to
death; and the Pope immediately confiscated all that he enjoyed
in the Territories of the Church, pretending, that the said
<i>Alfonso</i> was a Rebel to the Church: Whereupon he gave his
Nephew the investiture of the Dutchy.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Innocentius</i> the ninth succeeded to <i>Gregory</i> the
fourteenth, in the year 1509. who lived but two months, and by
consequence was not in a capacity of leaving much to his
Relations; many of them <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>nevertheless were already come from
<i>Bologne</i>, the Popes native Country; amongst whom he made
one Cardinal, and that was <i>Antonio Fachinetti</i>; but he gave
him no other Office, then that of a Referendary, there being no
other of any consideration vacant.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, I
believe, that he thought not of dying so soon, for else he would
have provided more largely for this Cardinal, and the rest of his
kindred; His death was very unwelcome to them, all having begun
already to build Castles in the air; but particularly to one of
them, who pretended to be General of the Churches Forces, to
marry a Princess, and be revenged of all his Enemies; but he came
so far short of all, that instead of the equipage of a Gentleman,
that he came to <i>Rome</i> in, he returned in a poor plight to
<i>Bologna</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A month after, <i>Clement</i> the eighth, of the House of
<i>Aldobrandino</i> of <i>Florenee</i>, was chosen Pope, with an
incredible joy of all the people of <i>Rome</i>: He himself was
born in the City of <i>Fano</i>.</p>
<p>This Pope found his Family full of noble and ancient Blood,
but as empty of Riches; therefore calling them to him, he began,
by his Predecessours example, to give them Offices, Places, and
Dignities, but with a certain moderation, and not precipitating
his Favours, as the others had done, but giving to day one thing,
and to morrow another, he contented them all without scandal.</p>
<p>In his first promotion of Cardinals, he created two of his
Nephews, <i>viz. Pietro Aldobrandino</i>, <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>his Brothers
Son, and <i>Cintbio Passero di Sinigaglia</i>, his Sisters Son;
and with the help of these two, the Pope did govern all the
Church Affairs, desiring every thing should pass by their hands,
particularly through Cardinal <i>Pietro Aldobrandino</i>, whom he
lov&rsquo;d most cordially, calling him, <i>the Idol of his
heart</i>; and often, for fear of contradicting him, he would let
him do as he listed.</p>
<p>The charge of General of the Church, was given to <i>Giovanni
Francesco Aldobrandino</i>, another of his Nephews; in which
place he enjoyed, not only all of the Prerogatives and
Priviledges that had been granted to the other Nephews of Popes,
but besides, his Holiness encreased his pay by two thousand
Crowns a year, and invented new priviledges for him.</p>
<p>In the year 1595. he bought the Marquisat of <i>Meldola</i>,
which he bestowed upon <i>Octavio Aldobrandino</i>, another of
his Nephews, declaring him absolute Soveraign of the said place;
but yet made him stay in <i>Rome</i>, that he might be at hand,
&amp; lose no occasions of getting something else from him: at
last <i>Alfonso d&rsquo; Este</i>, last Duke of Ferrara,
happening to dye in the year 1597. the Pope thought to take this
Principality for himself, as being devolv&rsquo;d to the Church,
and resolv&rsquo;d to give the investiture to his Nephew
<i>Octavio</i>; so having held a publick Consistory, in which he
declared, that the Dutchy of <i>Ferrara</i> was become the
Churches patrimony; and immediately ordered Cardinal
<i>Aldobrandino</i> to raise a powerful Army, and put himself in
possession of the said Dutchy, by driving out <i>Cesar</i> of
<i>Este</i>, who was Heir by <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>the Will of the late Duke, and was
actually in possession: But the Pope pretended, that he being a
Bastard, was incapable of inheriting.</p>
<p>The Cardinal soon got together a great Army, and so frighted
<i>Don Cesar</i>, that he was forced to fly to <i>Modena</i>, and
leave <i>Ferrara</i> to the Pope; and the Cardinal
<i>Aldobrandino</i>, after some Articles agreed on between his
Uncle and <i>Don Cesar</i>, entred the place, and took possession
of it in the name of the Church, with little joy to the
Inhabitants, who lost a good Master to fall into the hands of
Church-men, who change every day their Governours.</p>
<p>As soon as the news of the rendition of <i>Ferrara</i> came to
the Popes ears, he began, by all means, to procure the
investiture for his Nephew <i>Octavio</i>, for whom he thought
the Marquisat of <i>Meldola</i> but inconsiderable.</p>
<p>But he met with a strange repugnancy in all the Cardinals for
his design; they having, by a common consent and union, resolved
to oppose the Popes desire, and not endure, that the Church
should be depriv&rsquo;d of so considerable a City, which it had
but newly acquired.</p>
<p>The Pope foreseeing, by this reluctancy of the Cardinals, that
it was a business hardly to be carried in a publick Consistory,
forbore to speak of it there, but took another course; for
calling the Cardinals one by one into his chamber, he there
signified to them his desire; but they all refused to consent, or
be any wayes accessary to the alienating so considerable a piece
of the Popedome.&nbsp; So that the Pope thought it was not safe
to do it <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>without them, and by force, for fear of leaving his
Nephew involv&rsquo;d in a continual War, against all the
succeeding Popes, and <i>Don Cesar</i>: and therefore he
resolv&rsquo;d to go in person, and take possession in the name
of the Church.</p>
<p>A little after, he made another of his Nephews Cardinal, who
was <i>Silvestro Aldobrandino</i>, Prior of <i>Rome</i>, to whom
he gave an infinite number of Benefices.&nbsp; Thus
<i>Clement</i> did every day do his endeavour to procure riches
for his Family, either in lands or moveables, who of their side
were as ready to receive, as their Uncle could be to give,
particularly when it was ready money.</p>

<p><i>Leo</i> the eleventh, who succeeded to <i>Clement</i>, had
not the same good fortune; for being chosen in the year 1665. he
liv&rsquo;d but five and twenty dayes: In which time he projected
much, but executed little; amongst other things, he gave out,
that his design was not to advance his kindred, but only to
continue them in their quality, and make their Estates plentiful
and easie; which is a certain moderation, which most of the Popes
do affect to shew in their first administration of the Popedom;
for even <i>Sixtus</i> the fourth, who gave with so profuse a
hand, did still pretend, that he did nothing but what was lawful,
and to the advantage of the Church.</p>
<p>This Pope had many Relations in the Family of the
<i>Medici</i>, but in that branch which was not come to be
Princes; but his Darling amongst them, was <i>Alexander
Medici</i>, son to his brother <i>Bernardetto</i>, which
<i>Alexander</i> had a son of twenty <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>years old, called <i>Octaviano</i>,
which was the Popes Fathers name: Whereupon the Pope sent for
him, with an intention to make him Cardinal, and keep him by him:
but the very same day that he came to <i>Rome</i>, the Pope dyed,
without being able to promote him to that degree of honours which
was a great affliction to all the kindred.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Now let us speak of <i>Paul</i> the fifth, of the Family of
<i>Borghese</i>, made Pope in 1605. who in an instant filled
<i>Rome</i> with <i>Borgheses</i>.</p>
<p>The Pope was of a most kind nature, and particularly to his
kindred; amongst whom, while he was Cardinal, he was wont to
spend all his Revenue; but his greatest passion was for
<i>Scipion Carafelli</i>, his Sisters son, whom he had brought up
from a child; and him he made Cardinal, as soon as he was made
Pope himself, giving him the name of Cardinal <i>Borghese</i>; by
which name he was ordinarily called, and did subscribe
himself.</p>
<p>This Cardinal, was the interpreter of his Uncles mind, the
Mediator of his favours, and the Coadjutor in all weighty matters
of the State and Church: They that expected any kindnesses from
the Pope, were not to purchase them any other way, then by the
means of him, who commanded and governed the Pope and all
things.</p>
<p>The Pope, desiring to follow his Predecessours steps, and
employ his private riches to the publick ornament of the City,
took care to provide his Ecclesiastical Nephews of Benefices and
Church <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>lands; and his secular Kinsmen of Places and Dignities,
as they became vacant.</p>
<p>The plenty, into which this Pope brought his Family, was such,
that they themselves did scarce know how to dispose of it, there
flowing in upon them, every day, vast sums of money from all
parts of the world, to procure, by their means, the Popes favour:
Whereupon they, seeing no end of their riches, began, out of a
complacence to the Popes humour (who delighted in the ornament of
the City) to build certain publick Edifices, so noble and
stately, that the King of <i>France</i>, who hath a Kingdom so
rich, and powerful, and hereditary, would scarce have undertaken
the like, at the expence of his whole Kingdom.</p>
<p>The Cardinal begun the Fabrick of that <i>Palazzo
Borghese</i>, in the <i>Campo Martio</i>, which is not yet ended;
and to perfect it, according to the first design, it would
require the value of half the Churches Territories; nay, it is
said, that in the foundation alone, were spent above two hundred
thousand Crowns, for they were fain to demolish great numbers of
houses, and level hills, before they could bring the ground to
that true evenness, which the design required.</p>
<p>The Popes brothers began two Country houses of pleasure at the
same time, one hard by <i>Rome</i>, and a little without the
<i>Porta Ponciana</i>; the other at <i>Frascati</i>, in the
little hills called <i>Mendragone</i>: and we may easily conclude
what treasure was expended in these, by what the <i>Spanish</i>
Ambassadour said one day to a Gentleman of the Family of
<i>Borghese</i>, who waited upon him thither; for <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>the Gentleman
having shewed one of these houses, asked his opinion of it? and
had for answer these words, <i>My King would not have undertaken
in such calamitous times as these are</i>, <i>so great a fabrick
for his diversion in</i> Madrid.</p>
<p>His Holiness was so overjoyed, to see such princely
inclinations in his kindred, that he did nothing but study night
and day, how he should enrich them more and more.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis true, he needed not to trouble himself much; for his
Cardinal <i>Borghese</i>; who had the Popedom at his disposition,
took all the incomes for himself, and the Family of the
<i>Borgheses</i>, allowing the Pope a small matter, to please
himself with the mending of a Street, or a Church, or some
publick Edifice; this Pope having surpassed all his Predecessors,
in erecting new Edifices, and procuring by all wayes the ornament
of the City.</p>
<p>In those dayes the <i>Nipotismo</i> was most triumphant, all
the former Popes Nephews having never been invested with so
absolute an authority, as that of the Cardinal <i>Borghese</i>,
and the rest of his Nephews.</p>
<p><i>Paul</i> lived sixteen years in the Chair of the Popes, so
that the <i>Nipotismo</i> had time to give root and foundation to
their greatness, as indeed they did, but forgot to strike a nail
into the Wheel of Fortune, to hinder it from turning about; and
therefore not long after, it began to slide downwards, as we
shall declare in time and place.</p>
<p>At last, in the year 1621. <i>Paul</i> dyed, to the great
grief of the <i>Romans</i>, who lamented very much his loss; and
indeed he was a very good Pastour, though he were a little too
liberal of the <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>Wool of his Flock to his Kindred; for he left to the
Prince of <i>Salmona</i> alone his Nephew, above a hundred
thousand Crowns yearly revenue; to the Cardinal as much, besides
the vast sums of money layed out in those Buildings we have
mentioned; they were thought also, to have vast sums of ready
money, unknown to their Uncle; the Cardinal alone being supposed
to have above a million in <i>specie</i>: So that <i>Paul</i>
left not a farthing to the Church.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>His Successour was <i>Gregory</i> the fifteenth, of
<i>Bologna</i>, of the noble Family <i>Ludovisio</i>, pretty
rich, but very abundant in Relations and Kindred.</p>
<p>This Pope, before he began to mannage the publick Affairs of
<i>Christendom</i>, resolved first to establish the particular
Interest of his House and Family; therefore having seen the
example of <i>Leo</i> the tenth, who by reason of the shortness
of his life, could not bestow the dignity of Cardinal upon any of
his Relations; three dayes after his creation, he made
<i>Ludovico Ludovisio</i>, his brothers son, Cardinal; and the
same day he made <i>Ocatio Ludovisio</i>, his brother, General of
the Church, though he were absent; and as soon as he came to
<i>Rome</i>, he made him Duke of <i>Fiano</i>, and assigned him
other Lands bought with the Churches money.</p>
<p>The same day he distributed amongst some other Nephews, many
considerable Offices, both within and without <i>Rome</i>, though
most of those, upon whom they were conferred were absent, so that
it may be said of the <i>Nipotismo</i> of this Pope <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>that it was
great almost before it was born, or at least in its cradle,
entring into power and command before it entred into
<i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>The Cardinal <i>Ludovisio</i> was he that governed the weighty
Affairs, his Uncle depending upon him most absolutely; so that
often of Negotiations, and Court business, he would communicate
little or nothing to the Pope; and when his Uncle, out of
curiosity, would sometimes go about to inform himself how things
stood; his Nephew would presumptuously answer him, and say,
<i>What need you trouble your head</i>, <i>eat and drink</i>,
<i>and let me alone to serve you</i>.</p>
<p>Every step of this Cardinal was towards the advancement of his
Family; and the Pope, not only did let him alone, but would often
exhort him to make hast, least of a sudden he should be
depriv&rsquo;d of the means: which fell out; for the Pope
liv&rsquo;d but seven and twenty moneths; in which time, the
<i>Ludovisi</i> minded their business so well, that at their
Uncles decease they had amongst them, two hundred and fifty
thousand Crowns yearly revenue, besides ready money, and that
which they spent in publick buildings: So that this
<i>Nipotismo</i> does deserve the title, of the most subtle &amp;
diligent of all the precedent <i>Nipotismo&rsquo;s</i>, if we
consider the proportion of their riches, and measure the
shortness of the time that they were purchased in.</p>
<p>With all this they much studied publick applause, and to gain
to themselves the good will of the people, and <i>Roman</i>
Nobility; shewing great respect for them, and offering their
service willingly upon all occasions.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true,
there <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>was
not much credit given to these demonstrations, because that the
<i>Romans</i> were already accustomed to see such Scenes of
dissimulation: But nevertheless, their Uncle, neither alive nor
dead was not prosecuted with <i>Pasquinades</i>; his government,
or rather his Nephews, having not been so tyrannical as
covetous.&nbsp; And since the <i>Romans</i> leave them in peace,
so will we too, and conclude this book with the death of
<i>Gregory</i> the fifteenth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> that we have hitherto related,
is nothing but the Vigil or Eve of the <i>Nipotismo</i>; now
begins the Festival day, in the time of <i>Urban</i> the eighth,
of the Family of the <i>Barbarini</i>, who succeeded <i>Gregory
the</i> fifteenth, contrary to every bodies expectation, in the
year 1623. in the month of <i>August</i>.</p>
<p>As soon as the news of his Elevation came to <i>Florence</i>,
those few remnants of the Family, who were then under the
protection of the great Duke, flew, like so many Bees to
<i>Rome</i> (and the Bees are the <i>Barbarini&rsquo;s</i> Coat
of Armes) to suck the Honey of the Church, but they left not
behind them their Stings, wherewithall in sucking it, they stung
it most bitterly.</p>
<p><i>Urban</i> in the beginning, shewed not much <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>tenderness
for his kindred, though he did openly own, that he would call
them about him: And indeed, in this his beginning, and as it were
the blossom of his Popedom, he did one of the worthiest actions
of his life, which was the giving of a Cardinals Cap to
<i>Francesco Barbarini</i>, his Nephew, a Personage truly worthy
so great an honour being endowed with the singular qualities of
an exemplary life and integrity, which made him worthy, and more
then worthy, of the Popedom it self.</p>
<p>The year after, which was 1624. he made Cardinal, his brother,
that was a <i>Capucin</i>, and went by the name of brother
<i>Antony Barbarin</i>, whom the Pope loved entirely; he gave him
the title of Cardinal of Saint <i>Oposrius</i>, but he had been
so accustomed to the strictness of a <i>Capucines</i> life, that
being raised to this great dignity, he demeaned himself with the
same meanness as before; he had much ado to custom himself to
that great Cope which the Cardinals wear; neither would their
wide large Sleeves agree with him, and he had given order to have
them made close and streight, after the <i>Capucins</i> fashion:
But that that was most ridiculous was, that when he saluted any
body, instead of putting off his Hat, he would only put it back
with a nod, as the Monks do their Hoods; so that once, in the
presence of the Venetian Ambassadour it fell backwards; to the
ground, with no small laughter of the Assistants: Thus he was the
diversion of the whole Colledge of Cardinals.</p>
<p><i>Don Tadeo</i>, the Popes other brother, was made General of
the Churches Forces, Prefect of <i>Rome</i> <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>and in the
long reign of his brother, had so many Civil and Military Offices
conferr&rsquo;d upon him, that he could not remember them
himself; the rather, because that he never car&rsquo;d to
exercise the functions of them, so he might receive the revenue,
which he forgot not to put up carefully; that is, in a word, he
took a good account of the profit, but could give none of the
satisfying the obligation those Offices laid upon him.</p>
<p>In the year 1668. the seventh of <i>February</i>, the Pope,
that he might more and more fortifie the Family of the
<i>Barbarines</i>, created another Cardinal of that name, <i>viz.
Antonio Barbarino</i>, <i>Francesco&rsquo;s</i> brother, under
the title of <i>Santa Maria in Aquino</i>.</p>
<p>These two brothers, though elevated to the same dignity, were
nevertheless of a different humour; for one made it his business,
to edifie the publick by good actions; and the other, did nothing
but scandalize all the world by his vicious deportments;
insomuch, that whosoever will weigh the vertues of the one
against the vices of the other, shall see, that the ill actions
of Cardinal <i>Antonio</i>, are far heavier then the good ones of
his brother, though his brothers piety be very great.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis true, that when once Cardinal <i>Antonio</i> began
to frequent the <i>French</i>, that he changed, as it were his
nature, for of a covetous hater of Learning, he became a generous
promoter of Ingenuity, and very officious to all sorts of
persons; so that now we may say, that he is a noble Prince, and a
good Cardinal, whereas before he was esteemed an ill bred
Gentleman, and a wicked Cardinal, and as <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>much blame
and dishonour as he contracted then, so much reputation and
credit hath he now gained.</p>
<p><i>Urban</i> in the beginning shew&rsquo;d a most exact
diligence, in the government of the Church; and in truth,
Cardinal <i>Francesco</i>, and he, did take no small pains in
reforming the abuses, as well of the Clergy and Monks, as of the
Court and temporal administration; so that forraign Princes and
Nations were very much edified, by the Popes zeal, and Cardinal
<i>Francesco</i> his sincerity, by which he did endeavour to
please every body.</p>
<p>But after five or six years time passed thus in the continual
cares of the Pontificat, he began to grow weary, not of doing
good, but of doing it so often; therefore leaving the mannagement
of the most important Affairs to his Nephews, he began to take
his ease, and they taking possession of business, did at the same
time engross their Uncles inclinations and intentions, that they
did, as it were, bind his will to theirs.</p>
<p>Then the desire of growing rich did so blind them, that night
and day they did think of nothing else, but of the means to make
themselves Princes eternize their family, and fill their Coffers
with treasure.</p>
<p>As soon as any Abbey was vacant, it was immediately
conferr&rsquo;d upon one of them, and then as soon as any other
good Benifice fell out, it was presented to the other; so that
between them, they had all that was rich and worth speaking of,
at last both Cardinals, being so full that they could hold no
more, would bestow vacant Benifices <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>upon their little Nephews: nay, to
above five or six of <i>Urban&rsquo;s</i> little Cozens, were
given Benefices while they were yet in their Cradles; the
precedent Popes Decrees being despised, and by these proceedings,
the very bread taken out of the mouths of those Prelates, that
had served the Church with zeal and care; which was enough almost
to make them desperate, seeing little children, scarce born,
preferred to them, who had so much deserts.&nbsp; More then this,
I think it may be said, that some Benefices were disposed of to
those that were not yet born; for in the Articles of marriage of
one of the <i>Barbarines</i> with a Lady of the family of
<i>Colonna</i>, one was, <i>That a certain Abby should be given
to the first-born</i>; so that in the time of this good Pope,
Church lands were bestowed on those, who were not yet in the
world, but by imagination; and those that had really, and with
great pains, serv&rsquo;d the Church, were altogether
depriv&rsquo;d of their reward.</p>
<p>A certain Prelate of <i>Bologne</i>, who with great zeal had
bestirred him in his Ecclesiastical employment, went to
<i>Rome</i> to receive his recompence, and having presented
himself to the <i>Barbarines</i>, was desired to stay a little
while: This little while proved the space of eight years, in
which an infinity of Benefices were vacant, but the good Prelate
could get none of them, because that the <i>Barbarines</i>
divided all amongst themselves, he seeing this, resolved to
return home empty as he came; and as he was going out of
<i>Rome</i>, some body from the <i>Barbarines</i> told him, that
he ought to expect a little longer, and take a little more
patience: To whom, with tears in his eyes, he answered, <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span><i>They must
be Saints</i>, <i>and not men</i>, <i>who can see the bread eaten
from their mouths by the</i> Barbarines, <i>and not be cast into
despair</i>.</p>
<p>Another, who had stayed as long to no purpose resolved at last
to be gone; and being importun&rsquo;d by his friend to stay a
little longer, answered him thus, <i>If the Church</i>, <i>dear
friend</i>, <i>had as many Popedomes</i>, <i>as the Pope hath
Nephews and Cozens</i>, <i>and that there one that did not see
some where</i>, <i>I might have some hopes</i>; <i>but since
there is but one Popedom</i>, <i>I should be a fool to expect any
part of it from those</i>, <i>who do not think it enough to
divide among themselves</i>.</p>
<p>Of these examples, I believe, I could make half a dozen
Volumes in folio, and all of persons that are now living; but I
will not weary the Reader with the Lecture of them; Let it
suffice for him to know, that <i>Urban</i> never gave any thing
for a recompence, to those that had served the Church except his
Nephews had first refused it; and they refused so little, that in
the end, all <i>Urban&rsquo;s</i> rewards amounted to
nothing.</p>
<p>If any body could brag of a considerable fortune made under
the <i>Barbarini</i>, it was a sign, that such a one had
serv&rsquo;d them, and not the Church.</p>
<p>Thus in the year 1641. the Pope made <i>Ascanio Filomarino</i>
Cardinal, and Archbishop of <i>Naples</i>, though the service he
had done the Church, did scarce deserve him a simple Canonicat,
so far was he from meriting an Archbishoprick, yet <i>Urbin</i>
promoted him, because he had done most eminent service to the
<i>Barbarines</i> family: And indeed, in this <i>Urban</i> cannot
but be thanked, for <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>enriching the Church (though his design were not such)
with a person adorned with so many excellent qualities, which
made him worthy of the Popedom it self, having, since this his
elevation, edified, not only his Flock, but all
<i>Christendome</i>, and rendred most singular service to the
House of <i>Austria</i>, in the revolt of <i>Naples</i>, and the
business of <i>Massinello</i>, in the year 1647.</p>
<p>If the <i>Barbarines</i> pretend to the contrary, that they
have advanced and promoted those who had a true zeal for the
Church, they will do well to produce their names: But I desire my
Reader to take this precaution, and observe, that if any body was
rewarded, under pretence of having served the Church, there was
the Cheat; for they that pretended most to serve the Church, were
they, that in effect did work the <i>Barbarines</i> designs and
interests to an issue: Upon this account, in one promotion, were
made Cardinals the following Prelates, <i>Gio. Baptista
Pamphilio</i>, who was since <i>Innocentius</i> the tenth,
<i>Gio. Francesco Palotta</i>, and <i>Gio. Francesco de
Contiguidii da Bagno</i>; the first, because he had been Nuntio
in <i>Spain</i>, the second in <i>Germany</i>, and the third in
<i>France</i>; yet the Pope could never be brought to make
<i>Monsignor Visconti</i>, who was Nuntio in <i>Polonia</i>,
Cardinal, for all the great instances of that King, though the
said <i>Visconti</i> was a most worthy Prelate, and one who had
done the Church more service in his Employment, then all the
other three together; and yet for all that, he remained excluded,
while the others were admitted to that honour.</p>
<p>Why then was this affront done to <i>Visconti</i>?&nbsp; <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>I&rsquo;le
tell you; while he was in <i>Polonia</i>, he serv&rsquo;d the
Church, and not the <i>Barbarines</i>; and the others, in their
Nuntiatures, did the quite contrary.</p>
<p>Naturally <i>Urban</i> was averse from making of Cardinals;
and if some urgent necessity did not force him, could hardly be
brought to it; and yet for his family, he made no difficulty of
breaking the precedent Popes Decrees, and the Laws of the Church,
which forbid to make two brothers Cardinals, while they are both
alive: but he did this only to satisfie his Nephews; and at last,
was brought by them to make great numbers of other Cardinals; for
they, being towards the end of the Pontificat weary of heaping
together, began to think, how they should preserve their treasure
and power; and therefore, to fortifie their party, they obliged
their Uncle, to make a numerous promotion of their Creatures.</p>
<p>If ever the <i>Romans</i> murmured and made Pasquins, it was
in the time of his <i>Nipotismo</i>; for when the
<i>Barbarines</i> took away from the Church called the
<i>Rotunda</i>, that excellent piece of workmanship of
<i>Bronze</i>, (for which we have no name but Bell-metal) to make
that piece of Architecture and Pillars, which adorns the Altar in
Saint <i>Peters</i> Church, which is one of the most noble and
magnificent Works that ever was undertook, all the people cryed
in the streets, <i>Quod non fecerunt Barbari</i>, <i>secerunt
Barbarini</i>; and they thought they had a great deal of reason
to exclaim thus against them, because it was certainly affirmed,
that the <i>Barbarines</i> had diverted above half the metal to
their private use in their Palace; <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>and some say, that they made racks
for their Chimneys of it, but I scarce believe it.</p>
<p>But that Pasquin, which was made in the time that <i>Gustave
Adolse</i>, King of <i>Swede</i>, invaded <i>Germany</i>, was
fuller of curiosity; for there were certain Images in paper, that
represented the Church of God, all naked upon a little bed, and
full of the wounds she had received from <i>Gustave</i>, and
covered over with Flies or Bees, which were the <i>Barbarines</i>
Armes; near the bed, was the Emperour upon his knees, craving aid
from the Church, that he might fight for the Church; from whom he
did receive this answer; <i>I have nothing to give thee</i>, <i>O
my Defender</i>, <i>for the Flies have sucked me even to the very
bones</i>, making allusion to the <i>Barbarines</i> Armes.</p>
<p>Another time were found in the streets of <i>Rome</i>, a great
quantity of Pictures; in every one of which was drawn a poor
Prelate, asking Alms from the Church to content himself withall;
to whom the Church made answer, <i>For my part</i>, <i>I have not
a farthing</i>, <i>the</i> Barbarines <i>have taken all from
me</i>.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, was seen a Medal, which represented
<i>Pasquin</i>, loaden with Swords, Musquets, Daggers, and other
Weapons, with an inscription that said,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>To drive away the
Flies</i>;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which thing displeased the Barbarines beyond measure,
conceiving that all this was nothing but a design to make the
people rise in Armes against them; so that though they set a good
face upon it, yet secretly they disposed things to their defence,
in case of a sedition.</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>And
certainly had it not been, that the <i>Romans</i> did every day
look for the Popes death, there would have happened some
revolution, for the hatred of the people to the <i>Barbarines</i>
encreased more and more the longer the Pope lived; one thing
particularly exciting publick envy and jealousie, which was, that
the <i>Barbariens</i> did every day plant their Armes in some
place or another of the City, to eternize their Name and
Family.</p>
<p>One of my friends had the curiosity, to reckon all the Bees
(that is, the <i>Barbarines</i> Armes) that the <i>Barbarines</i>
had placed here and there, as well in the City, as in the State
of the Church, and found their number to be above ten thousand,
in Painting, Stone and Marble.</p>
<p>The <i>Barbarines</i> tryed to make themselves great Princes;
and trusting to the great sums of money which they had got
together, thought they might make themselves Masters of a good
part of <i>Italy</i>: Their first design was, to put themselves
in possession of the Dutchy of <i>Urbin</i>, which in the year
1631. was fallen to the Church, by the death of <i>Francisco
Maria della Rovere</i>; but they found the Cardinals very averse,
and resolved not to consent to the alienation of so considerable
a part of the Popedom; they thought therefore that it was better
to let it alone, considering the injuries they had already done
to <i>Venice</i>, and the great Duke of <i>Tuscany</i>, who
without doubt would have crossed their design.</p>
<p>But to be at once revenged of their Enemies, and draw respect
from their Friends, they fram&rsquo;d a design of driving the
<i>Spaniards</i> out of the <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Kingdom of <i>Naples</i>, and giving
the Crown of that Kingdom to <i>Don Tadeo</i>; this they thought,
by reason of the decaying State that the House of <i>Austria</i>
was then in, that they might bring to pass with little or no
trouble; but when the business came to be weighed, and discussed,
in the presence of a Prelate, of great esteem and credit, of
their party, he told them, <i>That the</i> Neapolitans <i>had
received such ill impressions of the Pope and his Family</i>,
<i>that they would sooner give themselves to the</i> Turk,
<i>then to the Barbarines</i>.</p>
<p>After this, they began to molest <i>Odoardo Farneze</i>, Duke
of <i>Parma</i>, a Prince who had deserved better from the
Church; and their design was, to deprive him absolutely of
<i>Parma and Placentia</i>, and give them to <i>Don Tadeo</i>;
but they met with greater obstacles then they expected, for the
<i>Italian</i> Princes, his Neighbours, being allarm&rsquo;d at
the <i>Barbarines</i> greatness, opposed them smartly; and the
Duke himself, being a noble couragious Prince, not only made a
stout resistance, but drove them and their Army back to
<i>Rome</i>; from which place he might have chased and expelled
the <i>Barbarines</i> themselves, if he had been as malicious as
they.</p>
<p>This Enterprise having thus failed, they fell to courting the
Republick of <i>Luca</i>; but in their courtship they were a
little preposterous, by shewing their desire of Empire, before
they had gained their Mistresses affections; for having
excommunicated her, the <i>Lucheses</i>, being advertised of
their good intentions, prevented, by timely remedies, the
execution of them: And thus the <i>Barbarines</i> were, fain to
give over with <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>shame that which they had begun with rashness.</p>
<p>Perceiving at last, that none of these Ambitious plots would
hit, and that all Princes and the Cardinals themselves began to
be weary of their long tyranny; they conceived a thought of
making the Popedome hereditary in their family, which thing
seemed at first feasible, because that most of the Cardinals that
had been created at their recommendation, had a very good opinion
of Cardinal <i>Francisco</i>; and besides, they had a secret way
of compassing this their design, which, though very wicked, was
yet well enough invented; and that was, to give to every Cardinal
of their creatures, who were much above the two thirds of the
Colledge; some one City of the Popedome, which they should enjoy
for their lifetime, as Soveraign Princes, and so make as many
Princes as Cardinals, but above all, they had resolved to present
Cardinal <i>Richelieu</i>, with the whole state of
<i>Avignon</i>, that they might have assistance from the
<i>French</i>, in the rest of their enterprize.</p>
<p>They had betwixt them, divers conferences and meetings upon
this new project, and <i>Don Tadeo</i> made every thing so easie,
that it was a great pleasure to hear him discourse upon it; but
Cardinal <i>Francesco</i>, who judged according to the rules of
conscience and true policy, laughed it out of doors, and
order&rsquo;d there should be no more mention made of it.&nbsp;
This design being thus crushed in the Cradle, to the great
displeasure of those that had conceived it, the <i>Barbarines</i>
layed aside all thoughts of becoming Princes, and continued <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>in their
wonted way of gathering riches, in which they met with all
success and facility, by reason of the great experience they had
of the interests and business of the Church.&nbsp; And certainly
there scarce ever was a more able and capable Nipotismo then
this, for no sooner were they in possession of the management of
the affairs of <i>Europe</i>, but they shewed themselves master
Politicians.</p>
<p>And indeed the authority which <i>Urban</i> gave to Cardinal
<i>Francesco</i> was not ordinary; and though the precedent
Popes, had in effect given all power to their Nephewes, yet were
they contented with the substance of the thing, and did not
affect new names, and titles.&nbsp; But <i>Urban</i> thought, it
was not enough to give the power, except he gave with it the
vanity, and appearance of honour; therefore his Nephew
<i>Francesco</i>, to be Cardinal <i>Padroen</i>, that is,
Cardinal, Master, and Lord, a title never heard of before in
<i>Rome</i>; for the Popes his Predecessors, when they spoke of
their Nephewes would say, for example, <i>the Cardinal</i>
Ludovisio <i>our Nephew</i>, <i>the Cardinal</i> Borghese <i>our
Nephew</i>: but <i>Urban</i> from morning to evening, had nothing
in his mouth, but the Cardinal <i>Padrone</i>, as, <i>call the
Cardinal</i> Padrone, <i>where is the Cardinal</i> Padrone,
<i>spake to the Cardinal Padrone</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> so that
nothing was heard up and down, but Cardinal <i>Padrone</i>, to
the astonishment of the Embassadours of Christian Princes, who
thought themselves honoured enough, to call themselves the Popes
Sons, and own him as Father, while he in the presence of their
Embassadours, gives the title of <i>Padrone</i> to his Nephew;
nay, in the presence of some Princes themselves, <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>he used
this Title, as it happened to the Duke of <i>Parma</i>, which
occurrence, as memorable, I shall here relate.</p>
<p><i>Odoardo Farneze</i>, Duke of <i>Parma</i>, was come in the
year 1626, into his little state of <i>Caprarola</i>, for the
giving of some Orders which requir&rsquo;d his presence; there he
received an invitation by a letter from the Pope, brought by
<i>Monsignor Fausto</i>, the Popes Steward, who waited upon him
with the Popes Coaches.</p>
<p>The Dukes intention was not to go to <i>Rome</i>, not that he
had any aversion to the Pope but because that he was well
informed of the teacherous proceedings of the <i>Barbarines</i>
towards many Princes, and particularly towards himself.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for fear, least a denial should be interpreted,
as a disrespect to the Popes Majesty; (particularly, having been
once before as far as the Gates of <i>Rome</i>, without going
into the City) and seeing himself so fairly invited, he resolved
to go as he was in the habit of a Travellor, and with a slender
Court.</p>
<p>The Pope indeed received him with all demonstrations of
kindness, but the <i>Barbarines</i> using their wonted
dissimulation, after they had given him some publike signes of
respect and civility, did likewise afford him some occasion of
complaint; of which the Duke being much offended, thought he
could do no less, then signifie it to the Pope at his departure,
and complain of the proceedings of the Cardinal <i>Padrone</i>
towards a Prince of his quality; but he did not give him the
Title of <i>Padrone</i>, but only of Cardinal
<i>Barbarino</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>The
Pope was displeased, to see the Duke thus angred, and went about
to appease him, but in vain; for having said that he knew that
the Cardinal <i>Padrone</i> had a very great esteem for his
person, the Duke interrupted him, and said, <i>Most Holy
Father</i>; <i>for my part</i>, <i>I know no other Padrone than
your holiness</i>.</p>
<p>This answer was quick, and biting, having been made to the
Pope himself, who thereby saw his Title of <i>Padrone</i> laughed
at; and indeed the Duke had a great deal of reason to mortifie
thus the <i>Barbarines</i>, who pretended to treat him more like
their subject, then like a Prince.</p>
<p>But the <i>Barbarines</i> ambition stayed not in the Title of
Cardinal <i>Padrone</i>; they took exceptions against the quality
of <i>Illustrissime</i>, with which hitherto the Cardinals had
been content for so many Ages, but pretending higher, strove to
find out some terme that should not be inferiour to the Title of
excellency, which Soveraign Princes in <i>Italy</i>, and other
places, did then take.</p>
<p>This important point was often discussed, and canvassed by
<i>Urban</i>, and the <i>Barbarines</i>, and more then four or
five singular Titles came into their fancies; at last they
pitched upon the word <i>Eminency</i>, which in effect he gave to
the Cardinals, not so much for their sake, as for his
Nephews.&nbsp; The Princes no sooner heard of it, but that they
might be even with him, they took the Title of <i>Highness</i>,
the <i>Barbarines</i> remaining much mortifyed at it.</p>
<p>But the best of it was, that at first <i>Urban</i> had no mind
that any of the Cardinals should use the Title of
<i>Eminency</i>, except those of his family; <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>but
afterwards foreseeing that the world would laugh at him, he made
his decree general for all the Cardinals.</p>
<p>All this while it seemed as if the <i>Barbarines</i> had
chained good fortune to their desires, all things succeeding
according to their wishes; and indeed they were become so high in
their commands, that they despised every body, and could hardly
brook that any Crown in <i>Europe</i> should oppose, or not
condescend to the satisfying of their insatiable
inclinations.</p>
<p>Never Prince was more absolute in a conquest, then the
<i>Barbarines</i> were in their administration of the Church and
City of <i>Rome</i>; they laughed at any body; let those that
would talke and prate; but nothing but derision and scorn was the
share of those that went about to contradict them.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis true, they had the good fortune to meet with little
or no opposition, for in the whole consistory of the Cardinals,
there were but five, who were not their Creatures, <i>viz.
Medici</i>, <i>Savelli</i>, <i>Carassa</i>, <i>Lauci</i>, and
<i>Capponial</i>, creatures of <i>Paul</i> the fifth, and these
too being of a quiet spirit, and not undertaking, durst never
oppose them stifly: The others who had been made Cardinals by
them did nothing but subscribe to the <i>Barbarines</i> pleasure
whatever it was, so they lorded it over the Church and State,
nay, over all Christendome, as absolute Monarchs of the
World.</p>
<p>This uncontrouled power having lasted three and twenty years,
<i>Urban</i> their Uncle died, leaving the Church in disorder,
the State in debt, and his family in possession of such vast
riches, that even the Stewards that managed them, could hardly <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>believe the
truth of their accounts.&nbsp; Two hundred and seven and twenty
Governments, Dignities, Offices, Abbies, and Benefices of the
richest sort, were then in the family of the <i>Barbarines</i>;
the Revenue of which was so great, that I believe the
<i>Barbarines</i> never computed it, though they receiv&rsquo;d
it.</p>
<p>The Catholick King, who is master of so many Provinces, and
who takes a pride in filling whole sheets of Paper with his
Titles, could not produce halfe so many as the <i>Barbarines</i>
could have done after the death of their Uncle.</p>
<p>As for summes of ready mony it is not to be imagined how great
they are that they have.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis believed, that Cardinal
<i>Francesco</i> alone hath under ground, above two millions of
Crowns in Gold; Besides what the Cardinal <i>Antonio</i> hath
hidden and spent in his long Exile; And besides what <i>Don
Tadeo</i> sent to <i>Palestrina</i>, to be buried in a new vault
under ground; and it is very certain, that about two months
before <i>Urban</i> dyed, there were met in two nights above
threescore and ten Mules, loaden with mony, going to
<i>Palestrina</i>, where <i>Don Tadeo</i> was to receive
them.</p>
<p>But we have another argument of the <i>Barbarines</i>
prodigious riches.&nbsp; For if <i>Sixtus</i> the Fifth, in five
years time, could spend five Millions of Crowns, in buildings and
founding of Colledges, and leave five millions more to the
Church, and yet give away three Millions at least to his
kindred.&nbsp; And if <i>Gregory</i> the Fifteenth in two years
time spent vast summs, for the succour of the <i>Valteline</i>
and the <i>Emperour</i>, and in the embelishing of <i>Rome</i>,
and yet left to his Relations the value of <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>above three
Millions of Crowns.&nbsp; Then I say, let any body judge what
riches the Family of the <i>Barbarines</i> are in possession
of.&nbsp; They that for the space of three and twenty year have
had the whole Popedome at their disposition; and who in all that
time never spent for the Church, or in publick Edifices, above
four Millions of Crowns in Gold; and yet the people was never
more oppressed: therefore we must conclude, That their riches are
immense; and if we may calculate them by comparison of what the
other Popes Nephews have got, they must have above thirty
Millions of Crowns; and they that judge well, will not think it
too much.</p>
<p>The power of this Nipotismo expired not with their Uncle; and
though under his Successor they suffered a sharp Persecution, yet
are they even now at this time so recovered of it, that they
still deserve the Title of the Nipotismo <i>Di Roma</i>, there
being three Cardinals of them alive, a thing which was never seen
before, and will scarce be seen hereafter in <i>Rome</i>, that
there should be three Cardinals of the same Name and Family; and
that which is most considerable is, that they are now in great
esteem with the <i>Romans</i>.&nbsp; <i>Francesco</i>, who is the
Elder Brother, being respected as a Saint; and if he be alive
when the Sea of <i>Rome</i> shall be vacant, he will go near to
get the Popedome once more into his family, and the Cardinals
ought to choose him for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, Because of the purity of his life, neither can it be
said, that he Counterfits Piety, and feigns devotion, as many
others have done.&nbsp; Because, it is not possible, that a man
shall equally deceive <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>the World in his Infancy, his youth,
his riper years, and his old age; therefore, certainly, since
this Cardinal hath appear&rsquo;d, even from his youth, to be
what he now is, we ought to conclude him to be of an unfeigned
integrity.</p>
<p>The second reason, for which Cardinal <i>Francesco</i>
deserves to be Pope, is his great experience in Ecclesiastick and
Civil affairs, there being no Cardinal now alive, that is half so
well instructed in them as he: so that upon this score
Christendome would be sure to be well provided of a Pope.</p>
<p>The third reason is, That the <i>Barbarines</i> being already
exceedingly rich, they would not now be so subject to that great
avidity of heaping treasure upon treasure as they were at
first.&nbsp; But I reckon without mine host, and would do better
to leave these thoughts to the Cardinals, who will have time
enough to examine them, since <i>Alexander</i> hath of late taken
new forces, and is not like to dye yet.</p>
<p>The second Cardinal of this Family, that is <i>Antonio</i>,
hath by his change of life, wiped away that scandalous
impression, which his first demeanours, under the Pontificat of
his Uncle, had given of him.&nbsp; And indeed, in that time he
did lead a life too full of liberty and debauchery, and did not
only scandalize all <i>Europe</i>, but by his proud carriage
disobliged the Embassadours of many Princes, and made the
<i>Romans</i> hate him so, that at midnight they would cry out in
the streets, <i>il Cardinal Antonio serve in Roma di demonio</i>:
but as I have said already, After he once began to frequent the
<i>French</i>, and follow their <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>humour, he changed his nature, and
the <i>Romans</i> changed their note to his advantage, seeing him
become generous, full of affability and civility, and much
enclin&rsquo;d to promote learning, so that now they cry
<i>Antonio Barbarino</i>, <i>sembra un angelo divino</i>.&nbsp;
But for the Popedome, he need not expect it; for all the Miracles
in the World, will not take away altogether an ill impression
from the <i>Italians</i>, when once it hath had a foundation in
their minds.</p>
<p><i>Charles Barbarino</i>, who is the third, is very obsequious
to his Uncle <i>Francesco</i>, who does with a great deal of care
give him such instructions, as may breed Vertue and Piety in
him.&nbsp; Many think that most of his good qualities are
feigned; but for my part, I think, we ought to judg well of
exteriour probity, and leave the secret of dissimulation to him
that knowes the heart; though most say, That he is
<i>Cardinal</i> Antonio <i>within</i>; <i>and Cardinal</i>
Francesco <i>without</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But now it is time to leave the <i>Barbarines</i>, and come to
<i>Donna Olympia&rsquo;s</i> brother in Law, that is
<i>Innocentius</i> the Tenth, who was chosen in 1649, contrary to
the worlds expectation; not but that he was endowed with
sufficient good qualities for so high a post: but that is the
least thing that is considered by the Nipotismo, who in the
creation of a new Pope are very careful not to advance one who
should prove the enemy of their family.</p>
<p>In this Conclave, the <i>Barbarines</i> had resolved to give
their votes; and those of their party, rather to Cardinal
<i>Medici</i>, then to Cardinal <i>Pamphilio</i>; <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>and the
sooner, because, that upon the point that the Cardinals were to
go into the Conclave, there were divers Pasquins made, and
amongst the others this, <i>Quardateri di far Papa</i> Pamphilio
<i>che vi Mandarebbe tutti in Esilio</i>; and this other,
<i>Pamphilio Mandara le Mosche in Esilio</i>: So that the
chiefest aime of the Nipotismo was to procure the exclusion of
<i>Pamphilio</i>, not only by means of their creatures, but also
by a formal opposition from <i>France</i>, which the Cardinal
<i>Antonio</i> was very earnest for in that Court; but the more
he bestirred himself for this exclusion, the more prognosticks
there were of a contrary success.</p>
<p><i>Innocentius</i> being then chosen in spight of the
<i>Barbarines</i>, began to persecute them most furiously, and
with so much rage and passion, that though at first no body
pittyed them, yet at last it was thought too severe a proceeding:
In the mean time <i>Rome</i> was furnished immediately with
another Nipotismo, as if it had been a perpetual custome and
tradition of the Church not to be without one.</p>
<p>This Pope had but one Nephew, called <i>Camillo Pamphilio</i>;
who by him was made Cardinal in the first promotion with the
Title of <i>Padrone</i>, though he were very unfit for so weighty
an Employment.&nbsp; But <i>Innocent</i> did think to instruct
him by little, and shape him for business.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true,
that in his Remonstrances, he would be so sharp and crabbed,
following the Nature of his Temper, that the Cardinal, farre from
learning any thing, was put out of conceit with business, and
began to hate it extreamly; and because the Pope continued every
day to reproach him with <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>his incapacity and dulness, the poor
Cardinal was often forced to feign sickness, and pretend some
incommodity to avoyd giving of Audience to Ambassadours, and
publick Ministers; thus would he be whole dayes without daring to
appear in his Uncles presence, in which time he did nothing but
contrive how he should be rid of this yoak; which though of Gold,
seemed to him to be of Iron, looking upon himself as upon the
greatest slave of the World.</p>
<p>And at last he began to think, that the precedent Popes having
declar&rsquo;d some one of their Nephews, Princes, and married
them advantagiously, it would not be amiss that his Uncle should
do as much for him.&nbsp; And indeed, when the newes was
published, that <i>Camillo Pamphilio</i> was made Cardinal, most
wise men wondred at it; Considering, that whereas, all the
desires of the precedent Popes had been to eternize their name
and family, by marriages with Princesses and persons of great
quality; yet that <i>Innocentius</i> having but this Nephew in
the World, as the only bud of the <i>Pamphilian</i> family,
should not only condescend, but, as it were force him, be a
Cardinal, and renounce Marriage; shewing therein an avidity for
present honour, but little or no care for his posterity.</p>
<p>But Cardinal <i>Pamphilio</i> considered better of it, and
seeing that all the Nipotismo consisted in him alone, resolved to
act all the parts of it, and play sometimes the Cardinal and
Politician, sometimes the Prince and the gallant, and so make up
a perfect Nipotismo.</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>To
help him in the execution of his design there happened the
fairest occasion that ever was; for at that very time, the
Princess of <i>Rossana</i>, being become a Widdow, and having the
happy qualities of rich, young, and beautiful; he thought he
might gain her; and indeed it succeeded accordingly: for this
Lady, though she were demanded in Marriage by divers Soveraign
Princes, was pleased to place all her affections upon the
Cardinal <i>Camillo</i>, who courted her secretly with a
resolution to marry her.</p>
<p>Neither is it to be wondred at that so accomplish&rsquo;d a
Lady, should encline to bestow her self upon one who was so far
from being lovely: For her end in it was ambition, supposing that
by this marriage, she would insinuate her self into the Popes
favour, and by her beauty and taking carriage, attract his
kindness, and so be mistress of the Church, the state, the Pope,
and her husband.</p>
<p>But things fell out farre different to her expectation, for no
sooner had the Pope the newes of the match, and that they were
promised to one another, but he immediatly banish&rsquo;d them
both from <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>The Princess made some resistance, and refused to obey this
his order; saying in her defence, That <i>he had liberty to
banish his Nephews</i>, <i>as much as he pleased</i>, <i>but not
the Roman Princesses</i>.&nbsp; Neither would she depart the
City, the same day her Husband left it; but some time after she
followed, saying, that it was not to obey the Pope, but to go to
her Husband.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>There
was no body in Court or City, who did not pity this Ladies case,
and tax the Pope not only of ingratitude towards a princess, who
had refused great Princes to marry his Nephew, but also layed
brutishness and dulness to his charge, as one who could not see
the infinite advantages this match did bring to his family; and
to say true, there was nothing in this alliance, that could with
any reason move the Popes indignation against his Nephew, who was
the only support of the family, and who for his natural defects
and incapacity of business, ought rather to have been excused,
then reproached with this so advantagious a change of condition;
where the fortune, the beauty, the youth, and the parts of the
Lady were incomparable qualities, which might be sufficient to
make a Queen, besides fecundity, which soon after she shewed.</p>
<p>Yet for all this, the Pope did stop his eares to all reason,
and guided, or rather miss-led by his own fancy, and the
perswasions of <i>Donna Olympia</i>, continued his severity
towards this new married couple.</p>
<p>If we may guess at the reasons of this so extraordinary a
proceeding, I believe the chiefest was, because, that this Pope
by an extravagant capriccio had resolv&rsquo;d to introduce his
Sister in Law, in the place of the other Popes Nipotismo&rsquo;s;
and he accordingly gave to <i>Donna Olympia</i>, an absolute
authority, not only over the Church and State, but over his own
person, not daring to take any resolution without this Ladies
leave.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>And
this was a thing without Example; for if <i>Alexander</i> the
sixth gave himself up to <i>Vanoccia</i> the <i>Roman</i>
Courtisan, by whom he had many bastards, yet he never
suffer&rsquo;d her to have any hand in the Government, but would
divert himself in his houres of recreation with her.&nbsp;
Whereas <i>Donna Olympia</i> was called to the <i>Vatican</i>,
not to serve <i>Innocentius</i>, but to command him, which she
did with so much authority, that she seemed to be the Pope, and
he to be neither a man, nor a Pope.</p>
<p>If ever the Church was shamefully set out, and satyrically
painted by the Hereticks, it was in this time; for there was not
any place where the publick discourse was not about this
extravagant fancy of the Popes to renounce his own Nephew, and
give himself and the Popedome, into the hands of a Woman,
heretofore&mdash;and now grown ambitious and covetous.</p>
<p>Catholicks and Hereticks together were astonish&rsquo;d, and
did murmure to see, that he who called himself the head of the
Church, should be subject to the appetite of a woman; and that to
her ambitious desires, he should be content to sacrifice his own
Nephew, and deprive himself of that help and succour, which
according to the example of his predecessors, he might have
expected from him.</p>
<p>If there were any Offices vacant, or places empty in the
Court, nothing was to be determin&rsquo;d about them, without the
advice of <i>Donna Olympia</i>; nay, if there were Benefices to
be conferr&rsquo;d, the Officers of the <i>Datary</i> or
<i>Chancery</i> durst not expediate the Bulls for them, having
receiv&rsquo;d an <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>express order from his holiness, to suspend the
expedition of all business, &rsquo;till his sister in Law was
instructed of it, and gave her consent.&nbsp; If any Bishopricks
were to be provided with able Pastors; all the competitors made
it their business to Court her; and that which was worst, was,
that they ordinarily carried it, who offered most money, and not
they that had greatest deserts; though it were true, That the
more the person was unfit, the more was he fain to give to be
admitted.</p>
<p>But this Womans pride, carried her to that point of insolence,
that not thinking it enough to have had a Cardinals Cap for one
of her young Nephews, altogether unworthy of so high a Dignity,
but pretended besides, that in all promotions, her voyce and
consent should be expected, and followed: From hence proceeded
that the Courtiers, seeing her exercise this power, either, out
of fear, or hope, did frequent her Palace, and daily go to wait
upon her, not daring to put any end to business already begun, or
begin any other, before they had acquainted her with every
particularity of it.</p>
<p><i>Cardinal Panzirolo</i> himself, Secretary of State to
<i>Innocentius</i>, and oppressed with multitude of affairs, and
the indisposition of his body, was not free from this base
Courtship; but that he might humour his master, who was
infinitely pleased to see <i>Donna Olympia</i> obeyed, was fain
to go in person very often to wait upon her, and give her an
account of all the secret negotiations of the Court, and of every
thing that passed through his hands: after which she would from
time to <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>time, go to the <i>Vatican</i>, followed with a
numerous company of Coaches, and her hands full of Papers, which
she had already drawn up, as she would have them pass, and there
stay whole houres with the Pope, in discussing, and ripening
other business that was next to fall in order.</p>
<p>The wits of the Court seeing this, could not forbear so good a
subject for <i>Pasquins</i>, but made them with all sharpness,
yet as secretly as they could, they being well inform&rsquo;d of
the danger, oft exposing the defects of those that Rule: and
though every body were mov&rsquo;d with indignation to see the
Pope so much mistake himself, as to preferre the company of a
Woman to that of his Nephew, and the Princess of <i>Rossana</i>
his Wife, the only prop of the Family of <i>Pomphilio</i>; yet
<i>Innocent</i> was so prepossessed against them, that he would
not hear of his Nephewes submissions and excuses.</p>
<p>These murmurs and satyrical Discourses were all this while,
either concealed from the Pope, or at least dissembled by him; as
being unresolved of the means that should bridle so many tongues,
and stop the mouthes of all Christendome; particularly, of the
Protestants, who made very good sport with this female
Government, not only laughing at the Pope, who by the assistance
of the holy Ghost could not discern that which was the ruin of
his reputation and family, but also by immodest representations,
and contumehous pictures, giving the world to understand, that
they were fully informed of the disorders of the Church of
<i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>But
at last the Pope, not being able to endure any longer the secret
reproofs, and publick affronts which he received from
Embassadours, and Princes themselves, as well as from the
greatest part of the Cardinals; resolv&rsquo;d to dismiss from
the Court this ambitious sister in Law, whose unbridled licence
he had hitherto countenanced, and to take away from her all sort
of command and power.</p>
<p>Thus <i>Donna Olympia</i> being banished from Court, and the
<i>Vatican</i> purged of her corruptions, the Pope bethought
himself of introducing a Nipotismo, that the Church might not
loose its prescription.</p>
<p>But before we begin to discourse of the particularities of
this new Nipotismo, it will not be amiss to give an account of
all the Popes kindred &amp; relations, and begin with his
nearest.&nbsp; He had one Nephew, and two Neeces, besides a
sister, of whom we shall say but little as, well because she led
a Nuns life in a Convent, as, because that <i>Donna Olympia</i>,
out of a natural jealousie between Women, took care to keep her
from receiving any kindnesses or favours from the Pope.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Prince <i>Camillo Pamphilio</i>, though after three years
banishment, he were at last recall&rsquo;d to <i>Rome</i> with
his Lady, was nevertheless in so ill a predicament with his
Uncle, who never was able to forget those tales which <i>Donna
Olympia</i> had continually entertained him with, to his Nephews
disadvantage, that he was in <i>Rome</i>, as if he had been at
the <i>Indies</i>, never coming neer the <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Pope or
Court, at which he was not much troubled, as one who cared not to
be concern&rsquo;d in business, and thought himself happy enough
in all private enjoyment of so lovely a Lady as his was.</p>
<p>Of the two sisters, the Popes Neeces, the eldest was married
to <i>D. Andrea Giustiniani</i>, who himself was a great
favourite of fortune: For the Marquess <i>Giustiniani</i>, a
person of great quality and estate, seeing himself without any
heirs of his family and name, cast his Eyes by chance upon this
Gentleman who was then very poor and low, and though, as it
afterwards proved, he was of the same branch of the
<i>Giustiniani</i> with the Marquess; yet it was at such a
distance, that neither of them did believe themselves at all
a-kin; he was then thus fortunately instituted Heir to a very
great estate, by which means the way to <i>Grandeur</i> being
made easie to him, he found no difficulty in obtaining in
marriage the neece of Cardinal <i>Pamphilio</i>, who being
immediatly after chosen Pope, the Prince <i>Giustiniani</i> saw
himself of a sudden become a part of the <i>Roman</i> Nipotismo,
enjoying those honours and prerogatives which the <i>Romans</i>
do use to observe towards persons of that quality.</p>
<p>But the Pope had no real kindness for him, and having given
him some profitable offices, refused to introduce him into the
management of business, but left him to play the good husband in
his own estate.&nbsp; And indeed employments of another nature
had been lost upon him, for besides that he had alwayes
retain&rsquo;d something of his <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>meanness when he was poor; there was
nothing laudable in him but a natural bounty; and the Pope being
well inform&rsquo;d, did abstain from using his service in any
thing of importance.</p>
<p>The other sister was married to <i>Don Nicolo Ludovisio</i>,
Prince of <i>Piombino</i>, Nephew of <i>Gregory</i> the
fifteenth, and brother to that Cardinal <i>Ludovisio</i>, who in
<i>Gregory&rsquo;s</i> time govern&rsquo;d all things.&nbsp; This
prince had enclin&rsquo;d to this match, out of an opinion of
making great advantages by it, as seeing at that time that
Cardinal <i>Camillo</i> was made Cardinal, and altogether unfit
for business, so that he flattered himself with an opinion of
being the only Nephew, and governing the Pope and Church.</p>
<p>But when it came to the push, he found he had misreckoned; for
<i>Donna Olympia</i>, his mother in law, disappointed all his
ambition by hers, not being dispos&rsquo;d to suffer that any
body should rule but her self: So that the Prince was reduced to
a meer complacence and obedience to her commands.&nbsp; Neither
was it to any purpose that sometimes he would complain of the
difficulties he found to be admitted to the Popes audience, and
receive those marks of kindness which seem&rsquo;d due to so neer
a relation, for <i>Donna Olympia</i> answer&rsquo;d him in a
haughty manner, That <i>it was honors enough for him that he had
been preferr&rsquo;d to marry her Daughter before so many
competitors of as great a quality as himself</i>.&nbsp; Whereupon
the Prince being unwilling to come to a rupture with one who had
so great an influence upon the Pope, would hold his tongue and be
quiet.</p>
<p><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Yet
from time to time he was forced amongst his private friends, to
give a vent to his grief by telling them, That the Popes Alliance
had brought him into the disgrace of the <i>French</i>; whereupon
his principality of <i>Piombino</i> was by them made a Theater of
their fury, for not being able to do the Pope mischeif openly, as
they would have wished, they did content their spight in ruining
a place belonging to so neer a relation as he was to the
Pope.&nbsp; So that the loss and dammage he receiv&rsquo;d, by
being thus allyed was certain; whereas the advantages were
uncertain and inconsiderable, consisting only in some incomes
from his place of General of the Galleys, and some such offices
which he little esteemed.</p>
<p>But when <i>Donna Olympia</i> fell once from that heighth of
favour, then this Prince being very sure, that the Pope could not
subsist without some body to help him in so great a charge; and
knowing himself to be in as neer a degree as any body, and as fit
for the employment, began to conceive hopes of being called to
Court, and admitted to the management of business.&nbsp; And here
again, The poor Prince was deceived; for <i>Innocent</i> had all
along conceived such an ill opinion, and received from <i>Donna
Olympia</i> such disadvantagious impressions of him, that he
would never see him, but when he had a mind to be merry, making
the Prince serve as a Buffoon to his diversion, and never so much
as mentioning any serious matter in his presence.</p>
<p>For all this the Popes relations were fully perswaded, That
the Pope must of necessity bestow <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>the Title of Nephew upon some body;
and seeing that among his kindred none would please him, they
went insinuating sometimes one, sometimes another into the Popes
affections. Innocent of his side was in perpetual conferences
with Cardinal <i>Pantiallo</i> about the same business, so that
every hour of the day they were examining the good qualities of
one or other to choose the most deserving.</p>
<p>In this scarcity of subjects fit for the employment, the
Prince <i>Ludovisio</i> thought, that the honour might fall upon
the person of Cardinal <i>Albergati</i>, who went by the name of
<i>Ludovisio</i>, but he soon found an exclusion in the Popes
mind, as being ignorant and uncapable of such a place.</p>
<p>The Jesuite <i>Fabio Albergati</i>, brother to the said
Cardinal, was the fitter man, as being endowed with learning,
experience, and great wisdome in the managing of business; but
the Pope declar&rsquo;d, That he would not make two brothers of
the same family Cardinals.</p>
<p>So that at last, of all those that had been brought upon the
Stage, there remained none but he that Cardinal <i>Panzirolo</i>
brought on, who was a prodigious off-spring of fortune, and the
wonder of Christendome, which was astonish&rsquo;d to see a Pope
so averse from his relations as to declare a supposed Nephew for
Cardinal, and Padrone: but before we engage in the
particularities of this singular event, we will say something to
instruct the Reader about it.</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>There
never was acted upon the Theater of the Court of <i>Rome</i> so
unexpected and strange a Scene, which therefore deserves to be
reckoned amongst the prodigious effects of Fortune; for the Pope
having no consanguinity with him, and he being without deserts,
experience, or any remarkable quality that might make him
conspicuous, nay, being scarce known, or at least not familiarly
to the Pope; he was nevertheless of a sudden exalted and promoted
to the degree of Cardinal, Nephew, and Padrone, as if he had been
the head of the <i>Pamphilian</i> Family: And to deserve all
this, there was no quality but that, being born of a Noble
Family, which nevertheless at that time was so far indebted and
decayed, that he was not to expect any assistance in his fortune
from them.</p>
<p>His name, not to hold the <i>Lector</i> any longer in
suspense, was <i>Camillo Astalli</i>, a young Gentleman of about
seven and twenty years old, of a comely aspect, and a handsome
winning carriage, though guilty sometimes of too many
complements, and in a word accomplish&rsquo;d, as they ordinarily
are, whose highest ambition carries them no further in
<i>Rome</i> then some Office or Prelature.</p>
<p>And that which most surprized the Court, was to see one
exalted thus, under pretence of serving and helping the Pope in
the administration of State Affairs; one who was an absolute
novice to all negotiations and policy, by reason of the few
occasions he had had to learn any thing of that nature.</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>But
the occasion of his coming to court and making himself known,
was, the alliance which the Marquess his brother had contracted
with a Neece of <i>Donna Olympia&rsquo;s</i>, for she being
ambitious had alwayes embrac&rsquo;d the occasions of marrying
her relations into noble families, as having a design to honour,
by such props, her own family of <i>Maldachini</i>, to whom that
flower of nobility was denyed, which was an affliction to a Popes
sister in Law, and a sister in Law that govern&rsquo;d with an
absolute authority.</p>
<p>As it fell out, it was very fortunate for the house of
<i>Astalli</i>, that they were allyed with her; because that they
wanted riches to maintain their gentility the more, since they
had at the invitation of <i>Donna Olympia</i> bought the place of
Clerk of the Apostolick chamber, which office had absorb&rsquo;d
the greatest part of their Patrimony; so that, if by chance the
possessor of it did fail to make a fortune, or did dye suddenly,
the whole family did run the hazard of being begger&rsquo;d for
ever.</p>
<p>But all fell out luckily; for <i>Astalli</i>, having by meanes
of his office and alliance got an entrance into the Court,
addicted himself particularly to worship and court Cardinal
<i>Panzirollo</i>, the Secretary of State, who had a great Empire
over the Pope; and that which was most fortunate, was, that this
Cardinal answer&rsquo;d the young mans affection with the like on
his side, being gained by his obsequious carriage; at which all
the Court was much surprized, considering that Cardinal
<i>Panzirollo</i> had alwayes discovered an inveterate hatred
against any one that was in favour with <i>Innocent</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Here
the contrary fell out, for <i>Panzirollo</i> made it his task, to
insinuate this young Gentleman into the Popes affections, which
at last he did so far, that the Pope was infinitely pleased with
his comely garb and handsome carriage; and when it came to be
debated, whom he should choose to ease him of a part of those
cares and fatigues which accompany the Popedom, seeing none of
his own Relations qualified for the Employment, he followed
Panzirollo&rsquo;s directions, and preferr&rsquo;d this young man
before all the other pretendants; so without any more to do, he
was created Cardinal, declared Nephew, proclaim&rsquo;d
<i>Padrone</i>, and had the name of <i>Pamphilio</i> given him,
together with the key of the Popes Closet, to go out and in when
he pleased.</p>
<p>As soon as this news was spread through <i>Rome</i>, the
Politicians following the humor of the Town, began to discourse
of what would follow, and endeavoured to penetrate the secret
causes of the Popes aversion to his Kindred, that should move him
thus to set up a counterfeit Nephew: In the mean time, the true
<i>Nipotismo</i> were all met in <i>Donna Olympia&rsquo;s</i>
house, there to condole with one another, upon this affront and
shame which had befallen them.</p>
<p><i>Donna Olympia</i>, who above all was enraged at this so
strange a mutation of government, and who doubted not, as it was
true, but that Cardinal <i>Panzirollo</i> was the Author of it,
went to him, and shewed her resentment in menaces and threats,
with all the passion a woman was capable of.&nbsp; The Cardinal
being satisfied, that he had <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>obtained his desire, was not much
moved at her reproaches, and those of her kindred, but answering
her with his ordinary gravity and flegm, told her, <i>That things
did not</i>, <i>as she might think</i>, <i>depend upon his
councels</i>, <i>but upon the Popes inclinations</i>, <i>who
lov&rsquo;d to do what he pleased</i>, <i>and nothing
else</i>.</p>
<p>All this while <i>Rome</i> was in a perpetual vicissitude of
tears and joy; of joy, to hear the new counterfeit
<i>Nipotismo&rsquo;s</i> transports; of grief and sorrow, to hear
the complaints of the old and real <i>Nipotismo</i>.</p>
<p>Ambassadours came laughing and merry from one Visit, to go sad
and full of tears to another.&nbsp; The Priests, adherents to the
old <i>Nipotismo</i>, said Mass, and implored patience from
Heaven for them in their sufferings; and the flatterers of the
new, offered thanksgivings, and prayed for help from Heaven for
the continuation of its power: while the new and false
<i>Nipotismo</i> went triumphant through <i>Rome</i>, and
received the respects of every one, the true and real one was
fain to sculk and lye close in the shadow of its afflictions and
disgrace.</p>
<p>The Railleries, the Pasquins, and the Discourses about this
new way of enriching the Church with a <i>Nipotismo</i>, were
infinite, there being no body that could imagine, from what Wits
could spring so many different Conceits, bad and good, as were
publish&rsquo;d upon this new subject.</p>
<p>The Cardinal <i>Sforza</i>, who had alwayes assum&rsquo;d to
himself the liberty of saying any thing; as <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>soon as he
heard the news of this resolution of the Popes, was the first
that began to make <i>Pasquins</i>, for the next day, in presence
of four of the chiefest Cardinals of the Colledge, he said these
very words, <i>Now that the Pope</i> Innocent <i>hath introduced
the custome of making false Nephews</i>, <i>the other Popes will
never fail of Nephews</i>, <i>for they will make whole Regiments
of them</i>, <i>and fill with such a generation our Colledge of
Cardinals</i>.</p>
<p>But the words of a certain Prelate of <i>Parma</i> were more
sharp and biting, which were these, <i>I foresee</i>, said he,
<i>that one day the Popes will throw Dice for their</i>
Nipotismo, <i>and take what comes uppermost</i>, <i>and so the
affairs of the Church will be managed at an adventure</i>.</p>
<p>Yet for all this, the new Nephew had all the interest of the
Church and State put into his hands, though with some limitation,
for the Pope communicated all things to him, and particularly
matters of State; not so much to lay the weight of them upon him,
as to instruct him how he should mannage them, for he durst not
yet trust to his small experience, for fear of being
deceiv&rsquo;d.&nbsp; Thus <i>Astalli</i> had properly nothing
but the name and honour of Cardinal <i>Padrone</i>, subscribing
to all the Nuntioes, Legates and Governours Commissions, and
receiving Embassadours, when the Pope was indisposed, though
still with the obligation of reporting every thing to his
Holiness.</p>
<p>As long as Cardinal <i>Panzirollo</i> liv&rsquo;d,
<i>Astalli&rsquo;s</i> fortune was prosperous and good, because
that the Popes kindred durst not by any means go about to
supplant him, though they hated him perfectly, <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>knowing
that the Cardinals perswasions would still prevail with their
Uncle more then their credit; whereupon they dissembled their
design, and, according to the custom of <i>Rome</i>, seem&rsquo;d
to rejoyce for that thing which they most abhorr&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>But no sooner had Cardinal <i>Panzirollo</i> yeilded up his
last breath, but <i>Astalli</i> began to perceive the decay of
his fortune, and to mistrust that which afterwards befell him;
for no sooner had this Cardinal shut his eyes, but the Popes
kindred went about to undo him, and easily compass&rsquo;d their
intention, the Pope beginning to revive that affection, which he
had formerly born to his Sister in law.&nbsp; One morning then,
as the Cardinal <i>Padrone</i> was rising out of his bed, he
receiv&rsquo;d a Message from the Pope, whereof the bearer told
him, <i>That by his Holinesses Order he was banished from</i>
Rome, <i>and forbidden the Popes presence for ever</i>; <i>that
he should lay aside the title of Cardinal</i> Padrone, <i>and
renounce the name of Nephew as well as that of</i>
Pamphilio.&nbsp; And in a word, not only all his Revenue was
seised on, but he could not get leave to transport any thing of
his houshold-stuffe or moveables.&nbsp; So that the poor Cardinal
was fain to forsake <i>Rome</i>, seeing that all <i>wayes</i> to
justifie himself were shut up, and all the favour he could obtain
was, that he might depart in the night, to avoid the derision and
mocking of the people.</p>
<p>The motive of this so severe a sentence, with which
<i>Astalli</i> was treated, as if he had been guilty of high
Treason, was this; The <i>Barbarines</i> having <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>been
recall&rsquo;d and reconcil&rsquo;d to the Pope, were now great
with him, and at their perswasion, <i>Innocent</i> had begun to
think of taking the Kingdom of <i>Naples</i> from the
<i>Spaniard</i>; upon which subject there were often Conferences
held between him, the <i>Barbarines</i>, and his Kindred,
excluding still from their Counsels the Cardinal <i>Astalli</i>;
who thereby perceiving, that the Popes Kindness for him did begin
to abate, thought it would be prudently done, to provide in time
some other protection, that so his fall might be less, and he
might have something to hang by, which might hinder him from
falling to the bottom of that precipice, which was digging for
him.</p>
<p>Having therefore penetrated into these secret designs of the
Pope, he gave the <i>Spaniards</i> notice of them closely, and
the advice came no sooner to the Catholick Kings ears, but he
immediately gave such Orders in the Kingdom of <i>Naples</i>, as
quite disappointed the <i>Barbarines</i> plot, by shutting that
door, which was to give an entrance to the execution of their
design.</p>
<p><i>Azzolini</i>, a Confident and Spy of <i>Donna
Olympia&rsquo;s</i>, took upon him to discover who it was that
had betrayed them, and after an exact search found, that it could
be no body but <i>Astalli</i>; whereupon the Pope banish&rsquo;d
him, and made <i>Azzolini</i> Cardinal for his recompence.</p>
<p>This sudden fall of the false Nephew opened all the mouthes in
<i>Rome</i>, who did not know of the reason of it, to exclaim
against the Popes inconstancy: but no sooner was the
<i>Nipotismo</i> <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>down, but that <i>Donna Olympia</i> raised her self
upon its ruines; for the Pope a weary of being alone,
call&rsquo;d his Sister in Law once more to him, and gave her
back again all her former power, and more, if more could be, the
true <i>Nipotismo</i> remaining neglected, and despised in all
these changes; for except some Offices and Places which they got,
they were little more advanced in the Popes favour; and in those
places, they had, it is true, a liberty of getting money by all
Arts, but still with the condition of dependance upon <i>Donna
Olympia</i>.</p>
<p>The avidity of the <i>Barbarines</i> was but a shadow of what
this Lady perform&rsquo;d in reallity; for under her government,
Cardinalships, Bishopricks, Abbies, Canonicates, and generally,
all Church revenues were sold, as in a Market, to him that bid
most: She little cared how full the Town was of murmurs, if her
purse were full of Gold; and that which was most intollerable
was, that not only the meritorious and deserving people were
neglected, but banished from <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>There was no more talk then of the Pope, all the discourse was
of <i>Donna Olympia</i>, many taking occasion to say, <i>That it
were fit likewise to introduce the women to the administration of
the Sacrament</i>, <i>since that</i> Donna Olympia <i>was
Pope</i>.</p>
<p>At last it pleased Almighty God to deliver the Church from so
great a scandal, and so unheard of one before this age, which
gave so fair an occasion to the Hereticks of inveighing against
<a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the
Church of <i>Rome</i>, with a great deal of reason.</p>
<p><i>Innocent</i> dyed in the year 1655. having reigned ten
years, four months, and some dayes; so that then the Sister in
law, and the <i>Nipotismo</i>, were fain to leave the
<i>Vatican</i> to the Pope that should be chosen, who was
<i>Alexander</i> the seventh, who now lives and rules the
Church.</p>
<p>The Cardinals thought of little less then of making
<i>Alexander Pope</i>, who went by the name of <i>Fabio Chigi</i>
of <i>Siena</i>, not that he was destitute of those qualities
which make a Cardinal worthy of that Elevation, but because that
he was newly made Cardinal, and too young to be a Competitour for
such a place; with all this, after three moneths time employed in
the Conclave, he was at last chosen, when he thought least of
it.</p>
<p>As soon as the news was spread in the Town, people began to
discourse about the new <i>Nipotismo</i>, which was to govern the
City, the State, and the Church; and there many began to reckon
up such a number of kindred, that they affirm&rsquo;d, there
would not be room for them in <i>Rome</i> it self, much less was
the Popedom sufficient to enrich such a company of hungry
Relations, and raise a family, which, though of antient Nobility,
was nevertheless very poor.</p>
<p>The ambitious, and those that desir&rsquo;d to be in favour
with these new Masters, rid post to <i>Siena</i>, not only to
carry this happy news, but also to have the priviledge of
offering their service first.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span><i>Don Mario</i>, the Popes brother, as soon as he
heard of his exaltation, immediately, without so much as putting
on new clothes, as his Wife would have had him, caused a Horse to
be sadled, and with two servants took his journey towards
<i>Rome</i>; having first receiv&rsquo;d from one and the other a
number of submissive complements, not without the title of
Excellence.</p>
<p>He was thus going on, and making Castles in the Air; insomuch
that he did scarce see those that came to meet him on his way,
seeming a man in an extasie, and a body without a soul, which
without doubt was gone before to take possession of his future
greatness; when at some miles distance from <i>Siena</i>, he met
a Gentleman, from the Pope, with Letters to him, in which his
Holiness did most strictly command, that neither he, nor any of
his Relations should stir from <i>Siena</i> to go towards
<i>Rome</i>, under pain of incurring their brothers indignation
for ever.</p>
<p>At this news, the poor <i>Don Mario</i> was as if he had been
thunder-struck; so that if at first he seemed a body without a
soul, it was almost true now, for all his blood retired to his
heart, and left him pale, like a Ghost, though otherwise
corpulent enough; he was in doubt whether he should infringe
these so severe commands, and continue on his way, or else obey
and go home again; the first seemed dangerous, the second
shameful; but at last, after some reluctancy within himself, he
resolv&rsquo;d to return by night to <i>Siena</i>, being
asham&rsquo;d to enter the City by day.</p>
<p>Being come home he communicated his Letter <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>to all the
kindred; and though it seemed a very severe one to them, yet had
they some little glimpse of hope in the ambiguous sense of these
words, <i>Do not stir from</i> Siena, <i>in no wise</i>, <i>till
you receive a new Order from us</i>: from this they took
occasion, not to despair of their fortune, guessing, that this
proceeding was not a defect of kindness in the Pope, but some new
politick trick.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Great Duke of <i>Florence</i>, in the mean time, forgot
not to send a Gentleman to visit <i>Don Mario</i>, and to present
him with such things, as he thought they might need in that
occasion; and by his example, many Cardinals and Princes did the
same thing; particularly, all the persons of quality of
<i>Tuscany</i> failed not, every one of them, to wait upon the
family of the <i>Chigi</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, that the Popes
Order carried, <i>that they should not change their way of
living</i>, <i>nor receive visits as his Relations</i>; but that
was too hard to be executed, since it was not in their power, to
hinder those that had a mind to it, from doing them that
honour.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Republick of <i>Venice</i>, whose maxime it is to keep the
Popes for friends (though they often have been so ungrateful, and
so little sensible of the service that this State does to the
Church and all <i>Christendom</i>, as to trouble its quiet)
having receiv&rsquo;d the news of the election, assembled the
Senate, to deliberate of the demonstrations of joy, which they
should shew to the Pope.</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>There
it was resolved unanimously, <i>That the House of</i> Chigi
<i>should be declared Noble of</i> Venice, <i>with all the
Prerogatives that the Senate uses to bestow on such
occasions</i>; which was done accordingly, and the Letters Patent
were sent to the Pope and his kindred in <i>Siena</i>, with the
usual formes, being followed immediately after by a solemn and
stately Embassie.</p>
<p>Thus the Popes kindred did receive continually great honour in
<i>Siena</i>, though it were some mortification to them, to see
themselves depriv&rsquo;d of that command and authority, which
they thought did belong to them, <i>de jure</i>, as being a Popes
Relations.</p>
<p>In the mean time, this neglect and denial, which the Pope
seem&rsquo;d to make of his dearest Kindred, got him such a
reputation through the world, that nothing was more discoursed
of, then of his holiness and purity of life; the vulgar did
expect no less then miracles from him; and hearing say, that he
had alwayes upon his table a dead mans Scull, and under his bed
his Coffin, they could not choose, but be confirmed in the
opinion of his holiness.</p>
<p>But the wiser sort, and the judicious, were not so easily
deceiv&rsquo;d; but reckoning, that it was either policy, or a
particular melancholy, which had flown into the Popes head, but
had not root in his heart, they alwayes said, <i>Let us see what
the end will be</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>And
indeed, after some time it was observed, that the Pope did as the
Traveller, who being in a small vessel, which was surpriz&rsquo;d
by a terrible storm at Sea, resolv&rsquo;d, that he might save
his life, to throw all that he had into the Sea, having then tyed
his baggage with a rope, he threw it over board, but still kept
in his hand, the end of the rope to which his baggage was
tyed.&nbsp; Just thus did <i>Alexander</i>, for though it seemed
to the eyes of the vulgar, that he had despised and thrown over
board his Kindred, yet from time to time he would hold out his
hand, and send them money, and all other things that were
necessary, there passing never a day, but they had news from him,
and he from them.</p>
<p>And once particularly (and this is a thing which I am an eye
witness of; neither do I think, that <i>Don Mario</i> himself can
deny it, if he will be sincere) the Pope feigning to send them
some Mules, loaden with Wax for certain Churches, sent them
indeed Mules loaden with money; which cheat was so great, that
the Muletiers themselves perceiv&rsquo;d it, complaining of the
extraordinary heaviness of their burdens; and indeed, what should
they have done with so much Wax, for there would have been
enough, if it had been really Wax, to have lighted the
<i>French</i> Court a whole year.</p>
<p>Another time, he took an occasion of sending some Silver
vessels, and some Silk stuffs, to be employed in Ornaments for
Churches, with order, <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>that they should be recommended to
<i>Don Mario</i>, to dispose of them according to the Popes
intention; but <i>Don Mario</i>, in opening the boxes, found
above four Purses full of Gold, Gold all newly coin&rsquo;d, with
the Stamp of the Popes-head upon them.</p>
<p>The Embassadours of Princes, and the Cardinals, having
perceiv&rsquo;d, that all this apparent aversion to his Kindred,
was but jugling and hypocrisie, made it their business, to induce
him by prayers and entreaties to change his resolution;
particularly, having observ&rsquo;d, that the Popes design was,
to be thus urged and pressed, that he might gain reputation in
the world, and be furnished with an excuse, whensoever, at their
request, he should introduce his banished Relations.&nbsp; And
indeed, they had gain&rsquo;d so much upon him, that he did begin
to hearken to their reasons with a milder countenance, and less
reluctancy: Yet there was one thing which hindred him from coming
to the execution of this his design, which was the Oath he had
taken before the Crucifix in the beginning of his Popedom, not to
receive his Kindred in <i>Rome</i>; but the Jesuites, who were
his Confessors, and who are as subtle Philosophers as learned
Casuists, found out an evasion, which much pleased his Holiness;
for it gave him leave to comfort his kindred, to yield to the
Prayers and Sollicitations of Princes, and to ease himself of a
part of the weight and cares of government.</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>They
told him then, that indeed it would have been a breach of his
Oath, to receive his kind in <i>Rome</i>; but that he might, with
a safe conscience, go and meet them half a dayes journey of
<i>Rome</i>, and so not at all endanger his soul: was much liked,
and put in execution by the <i>Pope</i>, though it seemed to the
Court a ridiculous evasion, which became the subject of their
laughter and drollery for a great while.</p>
<p>The Pope being then at last resolved, Orders were
dispatch&rsquo;d to <i>Siena</i> to the <i>Nipotismo</i>, which
was there assembled, in expectation of this news as if they had
waited for Manna from Heaven.&nbsp; So <i>Don Mario</i>, his Wife
and Children, and <i>Don Agostino</i>, with a numerous
attendance, left <i>Siena</i> and took their journey towards
<i>Calstel Gandelfe</i>, a House of pleasure of the Popes, where
they met his Holiness, who receiv&rsquo;d them, and embraced them
with the greatest demonstrations affection and kindness that was
possible; and after some short stay there, came back to
<i>Rome</i> with them in triumph.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the interim, it is worth the Readers curiosity, to be
inform&rsquo;d of an accident that befell <i>Padre
Pallavicino</i>, the Popes Confessor, a Jesuite, in hopes of
obtaining a Cardinal Cap, which at last he got, had undertaken to
write the Story of the Councel of <i>Trent</i>; which indeed may
justly be call&rsquo;d his, for the greatest part of it is not
history and relation, but an abundance of words, which he
endeavours to prove, that the history of <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span><i>Fra.
Paulo</i>, upon the same subject, was and is false, but he
stumbles at every step he goes, and is so ill furnish&rsquo;d
with Arguments, that for my part I must confess, that I never
believ&rsquo;d <i>Fra. Paulo&rsquo;s</i> History to be real,
sincere and true, but since I read the Jesuites: and he that will
profit by them let him read them both with an equal
disinteressment.</p>
<p>Now in this History, Father <i>Palavicino</i> had taken
occasion to praise the Pope <i>Alexander</i> in divers places,
and extoll him to the Skyes, as an Angel rather then a man, for
denying his own blood and relations, and keeping them at such a
distance from him.</p>
<p>The sheets were printed, and the book was coming out, when the
Pope went to receive his kindred at Castle Gandolfe, and had
brought them to <i>Rome</i>: This cast the Father into a strange
perplexity; and the rather, because that the Pope, before he
undertook his journey, had asked him his advice about the
business as being his Confessour; seeing himself in a strange
Labyrinth, he was mightily confounded; for if he councelled him
to receive them, that was to give his book the lye; and if he
exhorted him to continue in his first resolution, that was the
way to offend the Pope and his Kindred, and lose all his own
fortune.</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>At
last he resolved:</p>
<p>Which he did, by counselling the Pope to receive his kindred,
and by printing over again those sheets which made mention of the
Popes alienation from all humane affections.&nbsp; But the
Printer refused to do it at his expences; so that the good Father
was fain to have recourse to some of his devout Children, who out
of charity payed for the reprinting of about twenty sheets.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>No sooner had this new <i>Nipotismo</i> taken possession of
the <i>Vatican</i>, but the people began to murmur against the
Pope, making Pasquins, and setting them up in every street.&nbsp;
Thus he, who before was a Saint and an Angel, was now become an
Hypocrite and a Devil; and the belief of the <i>Romans</i>,
concerning the Popes infallibility, was much changed, from that
which they had receiv&rsquo;d before from the Divines; for now
they believ&rsquo;d at least, that if the Pope could not erre by
himself, yet his Nephews could make him erre: The Pope, who was
before ador&rsquo;d by the common people, became now
contemptible, insomuch, that going one day to consecrate the
Church of the <i>Peace</i>, which had been rebuilt by him he
receiv&rsquo;d a vile affront; for the Curate of that Church,
having rais&rsquo;d a triumphal Arch before it, over which was
the Popes Picture, with this Inscription, <i>Orietur in diebus
nistris justitia &amp; abundantia pacis</i>, some bold persons
had the conscience to put an <i>M</i> before <i>orietur</i>, and
change the <i>C</i> of <i>pacis</i> into an <i>N</i>; so that
then there was, <i>Monrictur </i><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span><i>in diebus nostris justitia &amp;
abundantia ranis</i>.&nbsp; In the Academy of the Wits, they did
recite and show Epigrams, which were very offensive to the Popes
and his Families reputation, though all were allegorically
veil&rsquo;d over: In a word, they were counted the most
ingenious, who could invent the sharpest sayings upon the
introduction of the <i>Nipotismo</i>.</p>
<p>But before we go any further, it will not be amiss, to see in
what persons, and how qualified, the <i>Nipotismo</i> did
consist: And I consider it in two wayes, that which is nearest in
consanguinity, and another, which is related at a greater
distance, and we will omit the women, that we may not be mistaken
by so great a number as there would be with them.</p>
<p>Six Males from that <i>Nipotismo</i>, which is of a very near
consanguinity to the Pope, that is, speaking of those that have
at this present part in the government of <i>Rome</i>, and
omitting the little children.</p>
<p>These are then first, <i>Don Mario</i>, the Popes eldest
brother; the Cardinal <i>Flavio Chigi</i>, who is, <i>Don
Mario&rsquo;s</i> Son; <i>Don Agostino</i>, and <i>Don
Sigismond</i>, who are Brothers, and Sons of another of the Popes
Brothers, who dyed before <i>Alexander&rsquo;s</i> exaltation to
the Popedom; and two other Brothers, who are Sons to one of the
Popes Sisters <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>that was married in the family of the <i>Bichi</i>; so
that in all, there are one Brother, and five Nephews, which make
a pretty compleat <i>Nipotismo</i>.</p>
<p><i>Don Mario</i> is five years older then the Pope, and though
by consequence he be threescore and ten, yet he is strong and
lusty.&nbsp; The Pope and he are very different in their
constitution, humour, and actions; for the first is tall, the
other low; the Pope is inclin&rsquo;d to learning, <i>Don
Mario</i> is strangely ignorant; the Pope is lean, and <i>Don
Mario</i> is fat; the Pope is noble and generous, and <i>Don
Mario</i> is covetous and miserable, thinking of nothing, but of
gathering and heaping together of money, little troubling himself
at the peoples murmurings; and yet they cry out more against him,
then ever they did against <i>Don Tadeo</i>, nay, more then they
did against <i>Donna Olympia</i> her self; he hath invented so
many new subtleties to get money out of those Offices which are
ordinarily bestowed upon the Popes nearest Relations, that the
<i>Barbarines</i>, who thought themselves masters in that Craft,
do remain astonish&rsquo;d to see themselves outdone by a new
beginner.</p>
<p>The Pope shewes him the respect due to an elder Brother, and
that is all; &rsquo;tis true, that of late he hath afforded him
more liberty, and a greater share in the Government then he was
wont to have, and he uses it to his advantage, missing no
occasion to improve his fortune; nay, he is <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>so
passionately bent to getting, that he ordinarily uses to say of a
thing he does not like, <i>There is nothing to be got
there</i>.</p>
<p>The good opinion which the Pope hath of his integrity, is the
poison which corrupts all the present Government; for being
prepossess&rsquo;d to his advantage, he lets him do any thing, so
he do but maintain plenty of Corn and Meat in <i>Rome</i>, and
keep the people from murmuring; but things do not go well, nor
with any honour to the Pope, for if <i>Don Mario</i> was honest
and sincere in <i>Siena</i>, he no sooner came to <i>Rome</i>,
but he chang&rsquo;d his nature, and made it his business to grow
rich by any means whatsoever; though the people send their cryes
up to Heaven against him, they come not to the Popes eares, who
all this while thinks, that <i>Don Mario</i> of <i>Rome</i> is
<i>Don Mario</i> of <i>Siena</i>, and there&rsquo;s the
mischeif.</p>
<p>The Cardinal <i>Flavio Chigi</i> his Son deserves neither to
be praised, nor blamed for any thing that regards the Government
of the Church, in which he is little concern&rsquo;d; for having
the Title of <i>Padrone</i>, or <i>Master</i>, he exercises his
mastership in taking his pleasure, avoiding with all possible
means to have any hand in business, least he should perplex his
mind, and be diverted from the taste of sensual delights, to
which he hath given himself up.</p>
<p>In his Uncles last fit of sickness, that he might not be
liable to the imputation of ignorance or <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>incapacity,
he bestirr&rsquo;d himself pretty well, and perform&rsquo;d the
duties belonging to so important a place as his is.&nbsp; His
assiduity and care appeared much, and the Embassadours, and
people of business were pretty well satisfyed with the goodwill
he shewed, being the apter to bear with the smallness of his
sufficiency.</p>
<p>But as soon as his Uncle was upon his feet again, the Nephew
began to withdraw his neck from the yoke, and not only gave over
giving of audience, but feigned himself sick, that no body might
trouble him.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, that he was really so
sometimes out of debauchery, and is forced to keep his bed in
good earnest.&nbsp; The Physicians then do never acquaint the
Pope with the true cause of his indisposition, though often
question&rsquo;d upon it, because they are afraid of irritating
him against his Nephew; who on his side gives them large presents
to oblige them to secresie.</p>
<p>He doth not much care to gather riches and treasure, for three
reasons.&nbsp; The first is, because his Father is already too
much enclin&rsquo;d that way.&nbsp; The second, because he hath
no desire to leave any thing to his Cozen <i>Don
Agostino</i>.&nbsp; And the third, because he hath no Nephewes to
provide for, that branch of his family ending in him.&nbsp; So
that he is content with the revenue of his place, which is above
200000 Crowns a year, which he spends nobly amongst his Comerades
and Mistresses; it being a common report, that he hath already
half a dozen Bastards by divers Courtisans; but <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>for my part
I believe they belie him, and lay their children to his charge,
as being the ablest to keep them.&nbsp; He would without doubt
enjoy his health better then he does if he were temperate, for he
is not above five and thirty years old, of a Sanguine temper,
with a good mixture of Melancholy, the colour of his beard and
haire being the same with his Uncles.</p>
<p>In his Legation in <i>France</i> he got reputation, shewing
himself noble and splendid, as also liberal on divers occasions;
and certainly he would have been prodigal in his presents, if
those Prelates that were with him had not counsel&rsquo;d him to
the contrary; so that he indeed lived after the <i>French</i>
fashion, but his dependants after the <i>Italian</i>, that is,
sparingly.</p>
<p><i>Don Agostino</i>, Son to <i>Augusto Chigi</i>, and <i>Don
Sigismond</i>, his Brother, are much in the Popes favour, and he
hath for him much more real love, then for <i>Don Mario</i>, or
the Cardinal <i>Flavio</i> his Son.</p>
<p>Of <i>Don Sigismond</i> there is little to be said, only that
the Pope doth every day bestow upon him some considerable
benefice, waiting only till he be of age to make him Cardinal,
being now in the year 1667 but 17 years old, which keeps the Pope
from admitting him to that honour, though it is thought, that in
the first promotion he will not fail to be created Cardinal, and
indeed with great deal more reason then Cardinal
<i>Maldachini</i> who was promoted for <i>Donna
Olympia&rsquo;s</i> sake, at <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>18 years old, though much more
unworthy of it then <i>Don Sigismondo</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
thought, that if the Pope should dye before he were made
Cardinal, his inclinations would rather encline him to marriage
then to a Batchelors life.&nbsp; But I am not of that opinion,
for <i>Don Agostino</i> his Brother hath prevented him in that,
by giving, and procuring for him no other but Church Revenues; as
Abbyes, and other Benefices, of which, if he should go to marry,
he must be devested, and then he would be so poor that he would
not meet with a match suitable to his quality.</p>
<p>As for <i>Don Agostino</i>, Fortune seems to have espoused his
interest; for from his first coming to <i>Rome</i> till this
present time, all things have succeeded very Prosperously, and
much to his satisfaction, having met with a match according to
his desire, and a principality, which was his hearts wish; so he
hath nothing left to long for.</p>
<p>This abundance of content hath so taken possession of his
Soul, that it hath quite blotted out the remembrance of his
former poor condition, insomuch that being puff&rsquo;d up with
pride and insolence, he scornes to take notice of the civilities
that the Gentlemen of <i>Rome</i> offer him when he goes through
the streets; whereupon he hath contracted the Names of haughty
and arrogant, and with them the hatred of almost all the
<i>Romans</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>He
never had any inclination to learning; but he hath a good natural
disposition for all those exercises which become a Gentleman, and
in which he behaves himself very handsomly; he is about 30 years
of Age, of a jovial disposition, loving company and mirth, and
little troubling himself to purchase riches and treasure, being
sure that there are enough to do it for him.</p>
<p>And indeed <i>Don Mario</i>, and the rest of the kindred,
think of getting what they can every one for themselves; but the
Pope takes no care, but for <i>Don Agostino</i>, whose purse he
has resolv&rsquo;d to fill as full as he can; and we may
conjecture of the Popes tender affection for <i>Don Agostino</i>
by three things which he hath done for him since his coming to
<i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>The first was, that the Nipotismo had no sooner taken
possession of the Vatican, but it pretended to give Lawes, not
only to <i>Rome</i>, but to the Pope himself, and that in the
dispensation of his favours to: and thus it was.</p>
<p><i>Don Mario</i>, the Popes elder brother, being the head of
the Family, did pretend, that one being to marry to preserve the
Family, it did belong to his Son <i>Flavio</i>, and the rather,
because his inclination did lead him that way; but the Pope, who
had a great affection for the memory of his brother
<i>Augusto</i>, refused to condescend to <i>Don Mario&rsquo;s</i>
desire, but declared <i>Flavio</i> Cardinal Padrone, and resolved
to marry <i>Don Agostino</i>, little <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>troubling himself at his elder
brothers grumbling.</p>
<p>From hence sprung some dissention, which from day to day
encreases between the family of <i>Don Agostino</i>, and that of
<i>Don Mario</i>, to the Popes great discontent, who to sweeten a
little the bitterness of this Pill, gave <i>Don Mario</i> leave
to call his Daughters, and their husbands to <i>Rome</i>; where
he desir&rsquo;d they should be respected as his Relations, and
he accorded to <i>Don Agostino</i>, that his brother
<i>Sigismond</i> might also be sent for, to whom he gave good
Church Revenues.&nbsp; This seem&rsquo;d to have pleased them
all, and exteriourly they shewed content and satisfaction, but
secretly, and in their hearts, they do like right
<i>Italians</i>, that is, preserve the memory of their injuries,
and a desire to be reveng&rsquo;d.&nbsp; And to begin; The
Cardinal <i>Flavio</i> little cares to get riches; and if he do
get, he spends it most prodigally, being resolved to leave <i>Don
Agostino</i> as little as he can.</p>
<p>This dissipation which the Cardinal makes of his revenue,
cannot choose but displease <i>Don Agostino</i>, seeing that it
is not so much the Cardinals inclinations, as a desire to offend
him that causes this prodigality; whereupon he infers likewise,
that that vast heap of treasure which <i>Don Mario</i> hath got
together, will not be for him, but for his Daughters, who are
married into others Families; and I believe in this he is not
mistaken, for <i>Don Mario&rsquo;s</i> affection to his Daughters
is very great.</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>The
Pope in the mean time can scarce show any kindness to any one of
them; but it is presently taken ill by the others.&nbsp; <i>Doth
my Cozen</i>, sayes <i>Don Agostino</i>, <i>think it so
inconsiderable a thing to be Cardinal</i> Padrone, <i>and mannage
all State affairs</i>, <i>to have the disposal of all favours at
Court</i>, <i>to treat with Embassadours</i>, <i>to have the
keyes of the Popes Closet</i>, <i>to govern the Chancery and
Secretary at his pleasure</i>?&nbsp; <i>What can he desire more
then to be a second Pope</i>!</p>
<p>But the Cardinal answers all this by saying, that the care of
business, and the Title of <i>Padrone</i> are not things given
him out of a design to honour him, for they are his perpetual
torment, and keep him from rest in the day time, and sleep in the
night.&nbsp; <i>But doth my Cozen</i>, sayes the Cardinal,
<i>think it little to have been made Prince of a Principality
hereditary to his Family</i>, <i>to have married a lovely
Princess</i>, <i>with the enjoyment of all pleasures</i>, <i>the
applause of the Court</i>, <i>and the liberty of living as he
pleases</i>? <i>are these things to be compared to the weight of
a Cardinals employment</i>, <i>in whose death all dyes with
him</i>, <i>and hath not the satisfaction to see himself
re-produced in this world</i>?</p>
<p>In these duels of competition is the present Nipotismo
perpetually engaged; depriving themselves of the enjoyment of
that happiness which their good fortune hath so liberally
bestowed upon them.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, that these complaints
are made but to their neerest friends and confidents.</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span><i>Don Agostino</i>, to say true, is much more in the
right, then the Cardinal, the Pope being much more oblig&rsquo;d
to advance him then any of them; for he is Son to that
<i>Augusto</i>, brother of the Pope, who maintain&rsquo;d the
Pope at his expenses in the University, supplying him afterwards
with good summes of mony from time to time, without which he had
undoubtedly been stopt in his course, and never been able to
arrive to that pitch of Grandeur he is now in: Therefore <i>Don
Mario</i> is unjust, and <i>Don Agostino</i> very just in his
complaints; for the kindness which the Pope receiv&rsquo;d from
his Father, can expect no less then a Noble retribution to the
Son, whereas all that the Pope doth for <i>Don Mario</i> and his
Son, &rsquo;tis out of pure favour, without any desert.</p>
<p>These jealousies, however they may be prejudicial to the Popes
Family, yet are they very advantagious to the Church; for if they
were all agreed, woe would be to <i>Rome</i>, and the Church:
such would be sucked by them all, like so many Bees; but being
divided, they stand in fear of one another, and dare not do
unbeseeming actions: for while <i>Don Mario</i> would have all to
himself, and leave nothing for his Nephew, and that on the other
side, the Nephew would have all for himself, and deprive his
Uncle and Cozen of their share, they hinder one another, and
<i>Rome</i> and the Church fare the better for it.</p>
<p>The second demonstration of singular affection, which the Pope
bears to <i>Don Agostino</i>, is his Marriage: <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>for as soon
as he saw him, he liked him so well, that he resolv&rsquo;d to
match with the greatest fortune of Rome, which was then the
Princess <i>Borghese</i>, daughter to the Princess of
<i>Rossano</i>, very rich, and having but one sickly brother, and
therefore looked upon as an heiress; but however, her portion was
two hundred thousand crowns in mony, besides the hereditary
estate, which was in her brothers hands.</p>
<p>This match did not at first succeed with that easiness that
was imagin&rsquo;d, though the Pope employed in the compassing of
it, the Jesuites Rhetorick; for the Prince Uncle, to the young
Lady, had a greater inclination for the Son of the Great
Constable <i>Colonna</i>, an accomplish&rsquo;d young Gentleman,
and already much in the Ladies favour.&nbsp; Therefore to avoid
the match, he pretended, that indeed he did take it as a great
honour to have his Neece so allyed to his Holiness, but did
desire to see <i>Don Agostino</i> better provided for, and in
possession of some eminent rank in the world, that his neece
might still maintain the degree of Princess she had
already.&nbsp; Upon this the Pope did every day straine himself
to make his Nephew appear greater and greater, giving places of
great profit and honour, and endeavouring to buy him a
Principality, which at last he effected; and though it were some
disgust to him to see the Prince stand thus upon his termes, and
make no other account of the honour of his Alliance; yet seeing
that there was not in <i>Rome</i> such another match to be found
out, he did continually keep some <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>Irons in the fire.&nbsp; Above all
others, Father <i>Palavicinio</i> a Jesuite did bestir himself in
it, and as he was one day pressing the Prince, who told him, that
<i>Don Agostino</i> was not yet sufficiently provided for; he
answer&rsquo;d, <i>If the Pope should dye to day</i> Don Agostino
<i>would have ready money enough</i>, <i>to buy ten
Principalities</i>.</p>
<p>While things were thus treating, the Prince <i>Borghese</i>,
Tutour to the young Lady, died suddenly, so that she fell into
the Tutelage of the Princess her Grandmother, a Lady of
incomparable Piety, and one who shames by her good life, even the
Nuns themselves, she does so much outdoe them.</p>
<p>The Princess of <i>Rossano</i> is her Daughter, and Mother to
the young Lady, and she to get the Popes favour, and have some
part in the <i>Vatican</i>, which she hath alwayes been ambitious
of, accepted the Propositions, and contributed much to the
Conclusion of the Match, which was almost broke off, in which
<i>Don Agostino</i> hath a great deal of reason to be happy,
having a lovely, handsome Lady, with two hundred thousand Crowns
to her portion.</p>
<p>The Pope was transported with joy; and being naturally
generous, he resolv&rsquo;d that the wedding should be kept with
all the magnificence imaginable, having assigned to <i>Don
Agostino</i> a hundred thousand Crowns for the expences of it,
which he accordingly layed out most nobly.&nbsp; <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Besides
this summe which was spent in Bals, Feastings, and Banquets, he
presented the Bride with Diamonds, Pearls, and the Rose, which
every year is given to some Princess to the value of 20000
Crowns, and yet in this very time the Catholick Religion was much
endanger&rsquo;d in <i>Germany</i>.</p>
<p><i>Don Agostino</i> after his wedding was over became so
arrogant, that not being able to contain his passion, he was
heard to say these words, <i>That he had a greater joy to have
got the better of his Rival</i> Colonna, <i>then to have
obtain&rsquo;d so great a Princess for Wife</i>: which coming to
the <i>Colonnesses</i> Ears, the Constable the Father made
answer, That <i>his Son had reason to have desir&rsquo;d the
Princess</i>, <i>because he had merit enough to obtain her</i>;
<i>but that</i> Don Agostino <i>was beholding to his Uncles
authority</i>, <i>without which he had never had her</i>.</p>
<p>And indeed the young <i>Colonna</i> lost nothing by staying;
three or four year after he married Cardinal <i>Mazarines</i>
Neece, the Princess <i>Maria Mancini</i>, a most
accomplish&rsquo;d Lady, and one who brought him above a hundred
thousand Crowns to her portion.</p>
<p>As for the third demonstration of the Popes love to <i>Don
Agostino</i>, it appear&rsquo;d in the great ardour and desire he
showed to make him a Prince; &rsquo;tis true, that the articles
of Marriage carried, that out of the Ladies portion there should
be bought <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>a Principality, as if <i>Don Agostino</i> had not so
much deserv&rsquo;d the Princess as the Popes Nephew, as in the
consideration of his being a Prince which was a little infamous
to the Pope.</p>
<p>And yet for all this the Pope would not suffer that the
Principality should be bought out of the Princesse&rsquo;s
portion, but with a new generosity gave to <i>Don Agostino</i>
seventy thousand Crowns, with which he bought the Principality of
<i>Farneze</i>, in the Patrimony of St. <i>Peter</i>, and was
declared Prince, not only by the Pope, but by the Emperour, the
said Principality being a feef of the Empire.</p>
<p>To these three effects of kindness adde the desire that the
Pope hath to gather riches for <i>Don Agostino</i>, for whom he
knowes that none of the rest will provide, and certainly you will
conclude him to be a very loving Uncle.</p>
<p>The other two Nephews are, as I have said, Sons to one of the
Popes sisters, married in the Family of <i>Bichi</i>; one of whom
is Cardinal and Bishop of <i>Osimo</i>; and the other Knight of
<i>Malta</i>, and General of the Popes Gallies.</p>
<p>The Cardinal at his first coming to <i>Rome</i> was not very
acceptable to the Pope; as well because he thought he had done
enough in promoting him to the dignity of Cardinal, as, because
he wanted capacity for any high employment.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
true, that he had not been long at Court, but he began <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>to lay
aside a certain simplicity, which seemed natural to him, and with
which he govern&rsquo;d very well his Bishoprick, and
endeavour&rsquo;d to learn the Arts of Government and
Negotiation, whereupon his Cozen <i>Floro</i> gave a good
Character of him to the Pope, not out of any design to oblige
him, but out of a lazy principle which made him glad to find out
any body upon whom he might lay a part of his burden, and this
recommendation was not without good effects for Cardinal
<i>Bichi</i>, for since that time the Pope hath admitted him into
divers particular Congregations, and does make use of him in some
occurrences, but very seldome the said Cardinal, being not in
truth a man of any great wisdome.</p>
<p>The other Brother, who is Prior of his Order, and General of
the Popes Galleys seems to be more favourably looked upon for the
Pope; often calls him to him, and grants him many more favours
then to the other.</p>
<p>This Gentleman hath got a great reputation in the World of a
very ingenious person, and well versed in all Sciences, but for
my part I could never find out the root, whence did spring so
much desert, for he never did any thing in the world worthy an
applause: he hath been sent above four times with his Galleys to
the help of the <i>Venetians</i> in <i>Candia</i>, where he never
did any thing like a Knight of <i>Malta</i>; for he was alwayes
afraid of fighting, even when he was cover&rsquo;d by the
<i>Venetian</i> Galleys, who alwayes were the first that <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>engaged
their lives and honour.</p>
<p>And all this proceeded, because he did not trust his people
that he had aboard; and he did not trust them, because he knew
they had reason to hate him, as having defrauded them of their
pay; for he did appropriate to himself most of that mony which
the Pope allowed for the entertaining of his Soldiers and Stewes,
who never were worse provided for then under this Noble
Gentlemans command.</p>
<p>But I think that it is the complements which the prior
<i>Bichi</i> makes to every body that deceives them, and they are
so taken with his Civility as naturally the <i>Romans</i> are,
that they in revenge give him those qualities which he is far
from possessing.</p>
<p>His intention is to be Cardinal, whereupon every time he goes
to see his brother he puts on his Brothers red Hat, and tryes it,
to see how it sits upon his head.&nbsp; But I am afraid he will
loose his longing; for the Nipotismo of the <i>Chigi</i> are much
against it; and the Pope himself hath declar&rsquo;d that he will
not make two Brothers Cardinals at the same time.&nbsp; Withall
this the Prior Courts his Cozens with the profoundest respect,
and the greatest submission that the lowest Courtier in
<i>Rome</i> would employ, and all to no purpose; for they all see
that he aimes at the red Cap, which they are resolv&rsquo;d to
hinder him from attaining.&nbsp; And the reason why they are so
averse to his promotion is, because they know him to be humorous,
<a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>and apt
to sow discord and dissention amongst them, which I believe he
would go neer to do, if he had the liberty of talking, which a
Cardinal hath.</p>
<p>Now if we will say something of the Women, who also serve to
make up the Nipotismo, we must begin with the Lady <i>Berenice
Don Mario&rsquo;s</i> Wife.</p>
<p>This Lady is of the Noble Family of <i>La Civia</i>, one of
the considerablest of the City of <i>Siena</i>, but ill provided
for by Fortune.&nbsp; Her husband loves her, and indeed she hath
qualities that do deserve his love, being very witty, and civil,
she had not been two year in <i>Rome</i>, but she was mistress of
all the Court Arts, and way of living, to the great satisfaction
of Embassadors, and Princes; who according to the custome of the
Court go to wait upon her sometimes, where they are not a little
surpriz&rsquo;d to hear her discourse so well and easily of
things which they only which have been bred all their life
amongst Queens and Princesses can talk of, and they are the more
pleased, because she does shew amidst all this capacity a great
deal of modesty, which gaines the affection and respect of those
that have occasion to treat with her.</p>
<p><i>Don Mario</i> her Husband is above eighteen years older
then she, who is not above three and fifty, and is so fresh at
that age, that one would scarce give her forty, she being subject
to no infirmity at all.&nbsp; At her first coming to <i>Rome</i>,
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>the Pope
declar&rsquo;d, that he would see her very seldome, giving her
leave to demand any favour by her Husbands means, but nothing by
word of mouth; and he did this to show, what a horrour he had for
that impudence, with which <i>Donna Olympia</i> used the Pope
<i>Innocent</i>, to his great dishonour, and is thought, that one
of the great reasons, that made this Pope keep his Kindred at
such a distance for a great while, was, because he was afraid of
bringing his Brothers Wife into the <i>Vatican</i> with his
Brother, the very name of a Sister in law being a most odious
thing to the <i>Romans</i>, for <i>Donna Olympia&rsquo;s</i>
sake; but indeed, <i>Donna Berenice</i> is another sort of woman,
and one who shews modesty and reservedness in all her carriage,
being unwilling to meddle with any thing to which she is not
call&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>There is nothing to be said of this Ladies Daughters, except
that the Popedom is come in good time into the Family of the
<i>Chigi</i>, for else they and their Husbands had been brought
very low; for when they were married they had nothing, and their
Husbands but very little, which was almost consum&rsquo;d by the
charge of children coming on every day.</p>
<p>The Pope, to content the Father and Mother, gave these Ladies
leave to appear in <i>Rome</i>, where they were receiv&rsquo;d
and treated very obligingly, by their brother the Cardinal
<i>Padrone</i>, and were also visited by all the <i>Roman</i> <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Nobility,
and by the Ambassadours and Princes.</p>
<p><i>Don Agostino</i> was also very kind to them, though with
reserve, being somewhat jealous to see them so near the Pope,
whose benevolence and good will he would fain ingross for the
Masculine line of the Family: And in publick the Pope did not
give any demonstrations of particular favour to them, that he
might not increase <i>Don Agostino&rsquo;s</i> jealousies, and
the Courts murmurs; but in private he bestowed upon each of them
three thousand Crowns; and in giving them this money, he said two
or three times, That <i>what he did was out of charity</i>;
<i>and that it was not his design to dissipate and spend the
Churches Revenue upon his Kindred</i>: And these Ladies, who were
born in <i>Siena</i>, and not in <i>Spain</i>, were not so
scrupulously addicted to preserve the honour of their Gentility,
as to refuse such Almes, as a <i>Spaniard</i> would have done:
And I believe, Reader, that you would be of the same mind, and be
well pleased, if any body would give you a good sum of money, for
the love of God, and out of pure charity.</p>
<p>Besides this, <i>Don Mario</i>, and his Lady, have without
doubt, been liberal to them out of that heap of Treasure, which
they so well know how to get together; so that these Ladies
journey to <i>Rome</i>, hath been, no doubt, a golden journey for
them, which we may conjecture, <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>by the state they live in now at
<i>Siena</i>, having bought divers Lands and Houses.</p>
<p>This is all that hitherto can be said of this
<i>Nipotismo</i>: But besides these, the Pope hath another
<i>Nipotismo</i>, of a remoter consanguinity; who are so many,
that they are innumerable; and the Pope hath been hitherto averse
to their coming to <i>Rome</i>, I believe, because he is
unwilling to disoblige the nearest <i>Nipotismo</i>; but if his
Pontificate last, as it is thought it may, the Pope, who is
naturally inclin&rsquo;d to do good, may by little and little
give them a share in his good fortune, by Employments, Benefices,
or some wayes.</p>
<p>Neither doth the Pope for all this, set aside his own content,
which is, to erect noble Buildings and stately Edifices,
wherefore he hath doubled the Workmen, in that vast Enterprize of
Saint <i>Peter&rsquo;s</i> Church, being very desirous to see it
finished; and having often said to some Cardinals, his
Confidents, that he should not dye content, if he dyed before
that were ended.</p>
<p>The <i>Nipotismo</i> is strangely displeased at this expensive
humour of the Popes, seeing him every day changing and
streightning some Street, and mending some publick Edifice, for
they would that that money were spared for them and the family of
the <i>Chigi</i>.&nbsp; Some dayes ago, Don Mario, and Don
Agostino, went about to <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>put some other less expensive design
into the Popes head, and particularly to oblige him, to give over
the Porch of Saint <i>Peter</i>, which is of so vast a charge:
but the Pope is not to be remov&rsquo;d from his inclination, and
takes it very ill, that they should controul him in his pleasure,
he, who not only doth not controul them, but hath given them all
the means they have; and he persists in this resolution the
rather, because he is resolved to have the glory of this
Enterprize, and not leave it to his Successour, who by a little
addition would perfect so great a Work, and then place his Armes
in the front of it as his.</p>
<p>Of late, <i>Alexander</i> hath been fain to furnish to another
expence, which is the Legation of the Cardinal <i>Padrone</i>, to
meet the Empress at <i>Milan</i>; and the <i>Spaniards</i>
pretend, that he appear&rsquo;d in greater Splendour, then he did
at the Court of <i>France</i>, as well to win their good will, as
to please his own ambition, in being seen in such pomp, in a
place where most Ambassadours of Princes were to meet, nay, and
many Princes themselves.</p>
<p>To say truth, the Pope deserves no small praises for his noble
inclination, in honouring sometimes one Prince, sometimes
another, but particularly for the zeal and piety he hath shewed,
in the choice of those persons that he hath promoted to be
Cardinals; for in three or four promotions he hath alwayes picked
out those, <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>who were most worthy of this eminent Dignity, having in
that little regard to any bodies recommendation, if the Subjects
themselves did not answer the expectation conceiv&rsquo;d of
them; and whosoever would enquire into the life of these his
Creatures, will be satisfied of their integrity and learning, and
confess, that many of them are worthy of the Popedom, and it may
be, it may fall upon some of them, after the death of
<i>Alexander</i>, who now thinks of little less then of dying;
for at his first coming to be Pope, he thought so much of it,
that now being weary of those thoughts, he thinks of nothing but
living.</p>
<p>All his drift now is, to oblige the Cardinals to a good
correspondence with <i>Don Agostino</i>, but he perpetually
disobliging them with his haughty carriage, &rsquo;tis thought,
that after the Popes death they will little regard his
recommendations in the choice of a Successour, if things do not
much change.</p>
<p>I would say something of the future Conclave; but I think it
is to no purpose, for the Pope doth little think of leaving this
world, though the Cardinals pretenders do every day long for his
death, that they may bring another <i>Nipotismo</i> in
play.&nbsp; And some are very much convinced, that he cannot live
long, considering the augmentation of his late indispositions;
whereupon those Cardinals, that compose the flying Squadron, have
often met in secret, to agree <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>about a Successour; but indeed, I
think that we ought to wish, that <i>Alexander</i> may live yet,
for in the present conjuncture of affairs, his death would do no
less then bring trouble to <i>Italy</i> and all
<i>Christendome</i>, which God forbid.</p>
<p>The Pope doth every day endeavour to get a protection for his
<i>Nipotismo</i>, and would fain have the <i>Spaniards</i>
declare Cardinal <i>Chigi</i> Protector of that Crown; and the
Popes Nuntio in <i>Spain</i> hath made great instances to obtain
it, that they, the Family of the <i>Chigi</i>, might be
strengthened: but I do not think he will obtain it, for the
<i>Spaniards</i> are too great lovers of themselves to protect a
decaying Power, which will rather be a burden then a help to
their Monarchy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> that we have said hitherto, is
but the Foundation of what we have to say: For to what end would
it be to have seen the <i>Nipotismo</i> in Rome, if we did not
see <i>Rome</i> in the <i>Nipotismo</i>?&nbsp; <a
name="page2_3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>And we have
been curious to pry into that which the <i>Popes</i> have done
for their Kindred, we may much more justly examine that which the
Kindred does for the <i>Popes</i>.</p>
<p>A <i>German</i> Prelate, who now lives, and has some Opinions
very different from the profession he makes of a Church-man; That
is, Who is more Heretick than Catholick, does upon all occasions,
and whensoever he happens into any company, where there is a
liberty of talking, profess his mind in few words, and without
any ambiguity, by saying, <i>That the</i> Popes <i>Kindred
acquire this world by their Uncles Indulgence</i>; <i>and that
the Uncle loses the other world by his Nephews Vices</i>.</p>
<p>This opinion, which by many Catholicks would be condemned as
Heretick, has nevertheless a great foundation in reason; and I am
sure that the most able and ingenious men of the Court of
<i>Rome</i> do allow of it, and maintain it, as being a
Prelate&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p><i>David</i>, who was King, Priest, and Prophet, was
continually in fear of being damned for others sins; and, as we
see, did every day desire of God to be delivered from that
imputation: And yet the <i>Popes</i> not only do not apprehend
that they may be damned for their Kindreds sins, but do furnish
them with the means of offending his Divine Majesty.&nbsp;
Certainly, the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Relations would take another
course if they thought they were out of the way to Heaven;
neither would they be so covetous in heaping riches together, if
they knew that the treasure of the Church is but in trust, and
not in propriety to the <i>Popes</i>.</p>
<p>The Duke <i>Valentine</i>, Son to <i>Alexander</i> the 6th.
did commit all sort of crimes imaginable, breaking <a
name="page2_4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>both Divine
and Humane Laws without any regard or consideration.&nbsp; But
that which was worst of all, was, that he covered his Vices with
the Cloak of the <i>Popes</i> Authority; Saying, whensoever he
was about to commit a crime: <i>That he did very well know what
he was about to do was just</i>; <i>for his Father</i>, <i>who
did give him leave to do it</i>, <i>had the Holy Ghost</i>.</p>
<p>This is the mischief that the Popedom does to the
<i>Popes</i>; or rather, that the <i>Popes</i> do to the
Popedom.&nbsp; For to say true, the Popedom would be holy if the
<i>Popes</i> were so too: But they do not desire it, or they
cannot desire it, being governed by their Relations: if not as
Popes, at least as private persons.</p>
<p>To this purpose I remember a Story which hapned about twenty
years ago, and to which I give the greater credit; because I have
it from a worthy Person, and one who heard the words which were
said.</p>
<p>A <i>Swedish</i> Gentleman had left <i>Stockholm</i>, the
Capital of the Kingdom, with a design to travel over all
<i>Europe</i>, as Gentry uses to do: But his principle aim was to
be instructed in the way of Worship of the Church of <i>Rome</i>,
and be well informed of the difference between the Protestant and
Catholick Religion, with a resolution to follow that which he
should like best; and he thought no place fitter for his design
than <i>Rome</i>, as being the City which gives the rule to
others, having in it the Head of the Church, and an infinity of
Church-men and Prelates.</p>
<p>In his way thither he met with another <i>German</i>, a
Protestant, who had the same design; whereupon having contracted
a great Friendship together, they continued their journey, and
hapned to come to <i>Rome</i> in the beginning of the holy Week,
which is the week before <i>Easter</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page2_5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Being
lodged, they began by little and little to frequent the Churches,
see the Ceremonies, enquire into the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Power,
into his Court, and a thousand other particularities, all
relating to the same end.&nbsp; The Magnificence of the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Habit, the rich Ornaments of the Altars, the
variety of Ceremonies, the Majesty of the Cardinals, and
Prelates, the Devotion of the Monks and Fryars, and the great
concourse of people to the Churches, did at first surprize these
young Gentlemen; and inflame in them that desire which curiosity
had already kindled.</p>
<p>Having observed all these things with great care and
exactness, they began to inform themselves of the Civil Power of
the <i>Pope</i>; of the Entrigues of the Court; of the Government
of the City and State.&nbsp; And in their exact Inquisition they
found that indeed all that Policy and Humane Wit could produce
was to be seen in the Church-Government, and did not much
disapprove of it: But no sooner had they (following still their
first curiosity) pryed into the business of the <i>Nipotismo</i>,
and discovered the interests of the Nephew towards the Uncle, and
the Uncle towards the Nephew; but they presently resolved to
return home, and live and die in the Protestant Religion.</p>
<p>The <i>German</i>, whether it was that he had dived into the
secret of the <i>Nipotismo</i>, or for some other reason, was not
altogether averse from changing his Religion; though by no means
he would not remain in <i>Rome</i>: But the <i>Swede</i> was so
scandalized at the Church-mens lives, that having conceived a
perfect hatred for them, he said to the <i>German</i>, <i>That he
would never be the Subject of a Bishop who should be the Slave of
his own Relations</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page2_6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Of this
Gentleman&rsquo;s opinion there are many, not only in Protestant
Countries, but in the middle of <i>Italy</i> it self; and I wish
to God, that many of those sins, which lie so heavy upon the
<i>Romans</i> consciences, had not been occasioned by the scandal
which they continually receive from the <i>Nipotismo</i>.</p>
<p>That which I have related of a <i>Swede</i> is not much
different from what I have to say of an English or Scottish man,
I know not well which; but I am a very fit person to relate the
Story, for I was present at the dispute which he had with a
French Bishop: which was thus:</p>
<p>This Stranger had been two years in <i>Rome</i>, in which time
he had had divers occasions of being known to the <i>Pope</i> and
his Nephews, as likewise of knowing them; and had been infinitely
scandalized to see the small care the <i>Pope</i> did take to
correct his Nephews extravagancies both in Morals and Polities:
But above all, he was much grieved to see that the <i>Pope</i>
had taken out of the Treasure of the Church the richest Jewels to
bestow them upon his Nephews; and that they made no scruple of
robbing the Church to enrich themselves.&nbsp; Having met in
<i>France</i> with this French Bishop, they fell upon the
discourse of Religion.&nbsp; The Bishop perceiving the ill
impressions he had received at <i>Rome</i>, thought it was a part
of his duty to endeavour to blot them out of this
Gentleman&rsquo;s mind, by telling him, <i>That it was impossible
to be saved out of the Church of</i> Rome.&nbsp; But all that he
could say was to no purpose, for the Protestant could scarce
afford him audience, but impatiently interrupting him, told him,
<i>That it was a hard matter that the</i> Pope <i>could save
others</i>, <i>since he did give his own Nephews a most
inevitable occasion of damnation</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page2_7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Every
day the Casuists are disputing, <i>whether or no a Thief may be
saved without restitution of his theft if he be in a possibility
to do it</i>?&nbsp; And they all agree, that he must either make
amends by restitution, or be damned.&nbsp; If this be so, how is
it possible for the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Nephews, if the greatest
part of their Revenues are the spoils of the Church, and got by
unlawful means, the <i>Popes</i> having raised that very money,
which they are so proud of, either out of dead mens graves, or
the veines of the living.</p>
<p>Though this be true, and that the mischief, which the
<i>Popes</i> receive from their Kindred be very great; yet it is
a necessary one, and so necessary, that many are of opinion, that
those <i>Popes</i> who do forbear advancing their Relations are
but small Politicians.</p>
<p>Three Reasons do particularly move the <i>Popes</i> to call
their Relations to them: First, The affection which naturally we
bear to our bloud and kindred, The conservation of their Persons,
and the Policy of their Government.</p>
<p>For the first, I hold him little better than a Beast, that has
no tye of Consanguinity upon him, having many Relations that need
his help; none but barbarous people are ignorant of those Laws of
nature, and are not altogether deprived of the use of them
neither.</p>
<p>This love to ones Relations encreases as the Relations
themselves do multiply.&nbsp; And we may say, that love naturally
descends; for in old people their love is greatest to their
Grand-children, and the fifth generation still carry the old mans
affections from the third and fourth.&nbsp; From hence proceeds,
that the <i>Popes</i>, who ordinarily are old, are so passionate
for the advancement of their Nephews, for whom often <a
name="page2_8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>they hazard
their reputations in this world, and their souls in the next.</p>
<p>With our Kindred there is no <i>Medium</i> to be observed; we
must either love them tenderly, and do for them all that lies in
our power: Or we must hate them perfectly, and become
cruel.&nbsp; It is not possible to be indifferent, and do them
neither good nor evil; that would be to be neither man nor beast,
which is impossible.</p>
<p>There has been some <i>Popes</i>, who in the beginning of
their Reign, out of Zeal and Piety, have shewed themselves averse
from their Kindred; not only refusing to favour them, but seeking
out all occasions of mortifying them.&nbsp; But what folly, what
devillish policy, what false hypocrisie is this?&nbsp; For my
part, I call such a disposition a vicious humour, which soon
passes out of them, or destroys them, Nature it self being
offended at this so unnatural a proceeding.</p>
<p><i>Adrian</i> the sixth, <i>Marcel</i> the second,
<i>Urban</i> the seventh, <i>Leo</i> the tenth, were all
<i>Popes</i> very severe to their kindred, having all sworn
solemnly at their Election never to admit their Kindred into
<i>Rome</i>.&nbsp; And <i>Adrian</i> the sixth was so extravagant
that he persecuted them: For he refused to give a recompense to
one of his Relations who had done the Church very good service,
only because he was his Relation.</p>
<p>But Divine Providence, which delights not to see Nature
despis&rsquo;d, reveng&rsquo;d this indiscreet Zeal upon these
<i>Popes</i>; for they all liv&rsquo;d but a very little after
their Creation.&nbsp; <i>Adrian</i> liv&rsquo;d but one year:
<i>Marcello</i>, <i>Urban</i>, and <i>Leo</i> liv&rsquo;d all
three together, not two Months compleat.</p>
<p><a name="page2_9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>So
<i>Innocent</i> the Eighth, <i>Julius</i> the Second, <i>Pius</i>
the Fifth, and our <i>Alexander</i> that now reigns, were at
first strangely averse from their Kindred, which was interpreted
by the People for nothing but Hypocrisie and Policy, that they
might acquire the Title of Saints and Holy Men; for, a little
after they were setled in their Kingdom, and in the Opinion of
the Vulgar, they all found out some excuse or another to
authorize their change; and particularly our <i>Alexander</i>,
who is now as kind as he was severe at first.&nbsp; And for my
part I must confess, that I always laughed at <i>Alexander</i>,
for his pretended zeale, in keeping his Relations at a distance;
and I never began to have a true respect for him, and believe him
really a Saint, till he had brought them to <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>And if Christ himself has left us written in the Gospel,
<i>That we ought not to despise our own Flesh</i>, how can any
<i>Pope</i> justifie an aversion to his Kindred?</p>
<p>Therefore I do not like that Answer of our <i>Pope
Alexander</i> to the Cardinal <i>Medicis</i>, who did make it his
business to oblige the <i>Pope</i> to call <i>Don Mario</i> to
<i>Rome</i>; for he answered this Cardinal&rsquo;s Prayers and
Entreaties with these words of Christ, <i>They are our Brothers
and Sisters that do the Will of the Lord</i>; as if his Brother
had done the Will of the Devil.&nbsp; And in the Example of
Christ he was mistaken; for he did not despise his Brothers, as
having never had any; wherefore his Words were mystical, and
contained some more secret sense.&nbsp; But we see that Christ
himself did shew particular favour to his Relations, as to the
two <i>Johns</i>, the <i>Baptist</i>, and the <i>Apostle</i>;
declaring one to be the greatest of Prophets, and giving to the
other the liberty of laying his head in his lap.&nbsp; But more
than that, he recommended his proper Mother <a
name="page2_10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the Blessed
Virgin, to the Apostle <i>John</i>; and all the Evangelists own,
that he was Christ&rsquo;s Favourite, and his Beloved.</p>
<p>After this Example, we need no other; and no body can be so
bold as to pretend, That it is Piety not to own ones Relations,
if Christ himself lov&rsquo;d his so dearly.</p>
<p>But the <i>Popes</i> are not so much to blame, as those that
blame the <i>Popes</i> for their affections to their Kindred:
For, alas! the <i>Popes</i> are Men, as we are; and, as such,
ought to be allowed something of our fragility.&nbsp; But in what
a <i>Labyrinth</i> are they engaged?&nbsp; For if they are really
averse and cruel to their own Blood, then Nature, Heaven, the
Example of Christ, and all the Reason of the World, does condemn
them for inhumane, ungrateful, and barbarous.</p>
<p>And if they are kind, and do receive them into <i>Rome</i>,
advance them, give them Places and Honours, then Pasquins,
Murmurs, Raileries, Affronts, and a thousand Tales of them, are
the recompense they are to expect from the Vulgar, who send their
Cries to Heaven, and their Complaints about the World against
them.</p>
<p>Those <i>Popes</i> that first invented the Title of
<i>Cardinal Padrone</i>, had it may be a mind to imitate our
Saviour, who declared <i>John</i> the Evangelist his Cosin, to be
his Favorite and beloved Disciple: For <i>Gregory</i> the
Fifteenth was wont to call his Nephew <i>Ludovisio</i>, his
beloved <i>John</i>, though his Name was <i>Lewis</i>; and he did
so to shew, That since Christ declared in favour of his Cosin,
the <i>Popes</i> might also declare in favour of their
Nephews.</p>
<p>For my part, I am of opinion, that let them do what they will,
it is not in their power not to love their <a
name="page2_11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Relations,
and to abstain from doing of them all the good imaginable.&nbsp;
And we have seen the experience of this in <i>Alexander</i> the
Seventh, who made as if he had had no affection for them; but
Nature soon made him lay aside this Mask, and profess himself a
Man, as the rest.</p>
<p>This is then one of the Reasons that move the <i>Popes</i> to
be so tender of their Kindreds Advantages: But there is a second,
which is not any ways inferiour to this, which is the
preservation of their proper Person.</p>
<p>One of the greatest misfortunes of a Princely Life, is the
perpetual care and sollicitude they are in, of preserving
themselves.&nbsp; Their Goodness is often the subject of their
Neighbours Envy.&nbsp; If they be wicked, they are hated by their
own Subjects.&nbsp; So that often they are in doubt which they
shall chuse to be, Good or Bad.</p>
<p>Was there a greater Prince than <i>Henry</i> the Third of
<i>France</i>?&nbsp; Was there ever any thing more magnanimous
and good, than <i>Henry</i> the Fourth his Successor?&nbsp; And
yet their Greatness, their Bounty, and their Generosity, could
not preserve their Persons, but saw their blood shed most
miserably by the hands of barbarous Murderers.</p>
<p>But was there ever a better Prince in the World than the late
King of <i>England</i>, <i>Charles</i> the First, who had no
fault but that he was too good?&nbsp; And yet such Royal Goodness
could not preserve him (I tremble to speak of it) from the
barbarous hands of his own Subjects; and upon an ignominious
Scaffold, was forced to lose his Life by a fatal Ax.</p>
<p>What are Kingdoms and States, to any body, if they must be
perpetually from morning to night busied <a
name="page2_12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>about their
own preservation?&nbsp; And what a misfortune to a Man is a
Kingdom, if to preserve himself from his own Subjects, he must be
fain to raise Cittadels and build Castles in all the places where
he goes, that he can never sleep, if Guards and Sentinels do not
watch for him?&nbsp; Certainly a Subject&rsquo;s condition, that
takes his rest without fear, is much more to be valued, than the
perpetual perplexity of a fearful Prince.</p>
<p>The <i>Popes</i> nevertheless are these unfortunate Men, and
are more exposed to the danger of being made away, than all the
Princes of <i>Christendom</i>.&nbsp; For if any body be so bold
and wicked as to wish and desire the death of a Prince whose
Crown is Hereditary; yet he stops in his Enterprise, and
considers, That he must fear the Sons Vengeance.&nbsp; Those Men
who consented to the death, or, to say better, pronounced
Sentence upon the late King of <i>England</i>, wheresoever they
are now, they do without doubt repent their Action; and if they
had ever thought of the happy Restauration of <i>Charles</i> the
Second, they had dealt otherwise with his Father.&nbsp; So that I
must say, by the leave of those <i>Cromwellian</i> Politicians,
That they were but pittiful ones that could not foresee
that.&nbsp; Wo be to those that offend a Prince, in hopes that
his Heir will forget the offence.</p>
<p>This Reason procures some Security to Princes of an Hereditary
Kingdom, and makes the <i>Popes</i> endeavour to find out some
means also to secure themselves by their Kindred: For it is well
known how many <i>Popes</i> have been poysoned and made away,
sometimes by Emperours, sometimes by the People, sometimes by
particular Persons; and yet no body has ever taken upon them to
revenge their death.&nbsp; And <a name="page2_13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>why?&nbsp; Because that their
Kindred, not being Heirs of their Power, are not in a capacity to
shew their resentment; and are much more busied in getting into
the next <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> favour, who is ordinarily their
Enemy, than in revenging their Uncle&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The Cardinals themselves, who for their own Interest are not
much concerned in the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> preservation, do not
trouble themselves to inquire by what means he came to his end;
&rsquo;tis enough for them that the Popedom is vacant, and that
they have the Authority of chusing a Successor, who must be one
of themselves.</p>
<p>The <i>Popes</i> Lives are a perpetual War; for without they
are set upon by the Cares and Troubles of their Employment, and
within by the fear of death, which is so great in them, that they
are afraid of the very Air they breath.</p>
<p><i>Sixtus</i> the Fifth went one day to the Convent of the
Apostles, which was assigned to the Fryars of the Order he had
bin of: and coming in of a sudden without giving any warning, met
in their Refectory with a Brother who was eating a Mess of Beans
very hungrily.&nbsp; The good <i>Pope</i> remembring his ancient
condition, sat down by him upon a wooden Form, and fell to eating
with as great an appetite as the Brother, and made him fill the
Dish up again when they had emptied it.</p>
<p>The <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Followers wondered, and were much
surprized at his Phancy, or rather extravagant Appetite; but he
taking no notice of them, continued to eat on with his wooden
Spoon, the Beans that were very well oyled.&nbsp; At last having
emptied the Dish a second time, and thanked the Brother for his
kindness, he turned to his Followers and said, <a
name="page2_14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span><i>This
Dish of Beans will make me live two years longer than I should
have done</i>; <i>for I have eaten them with pleasure</i>, <i>and
without fear</i>.&nbsp; Then lifting up his hands and eyes to
Heaven, he blessed God that had given a <i>Pope</i> once in his
life an occasion of eating a meals Meat in quiet.</p>
<p><i>Pius</i> the Fifth, who was very lean, was used to say,
<i>That it was impossible that the</i> Popes <i>should ever grow
fat</i>, <i>for that Nature in them was never supplied but in
fear</i>.&nbsp; And yet this <i>Pope</i> was one of the holiest
and best; though it is true, That Holiness is subject to Envy,
and therefore obliged to preserve it self against the malignity
of its Enemies.</p>
<p>And indeed the diligence which the <i>Popes</i> use in
preserving themselves, is such, that it cannot chuse but
communicate to them a continual apprehension of some imminent
danger: for they do not only watch what they eat, but they never
eat any thing which has not been first tasted by those that dress
it, and serve it up; chusing ordinarily upon a sudden, and not
bespeaking that which they like.</p>
<p><i>Paul</i> the Fourth was wont to give the greatest part of
his Dinner to those that stood by, and make them eat it in his
presence; and then often he would take some of that which they
had left: So that the whole Court was in perpetual fear, seeing
the <i>Pope</i> so timerous.</p>
<p>But fear is not only inseparable from them at Table, but at
the Altar too; where they never eat the consecrated Host, before
they have given a part of it to the Sacristan there present,
whose care it is to provide them, and to eat that part which he
receives from the <i>Pope</i>; who having divided it into two
parts, gives him sometimes the right side, sometimes the left, as
he pleases.</p>
<p><a name="page2_15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>The
same precaution is used in the taking of the Cup or Chalice,
which the <i>Pope</i> never tastes, till the Sacristan has drunk
some of it before him.&nbsp; So that it is evident, That the
<i>Popes</i> do use many more preventions than any other
Prince.</p>
<p>Now if it be thus with them, can they do better than to call
about them their proper Kindred, into whose hands they may commit
their Persons?&nbsp; Who will take a greater care of their
preservation, than they who hope for Riches and Honour to their
Family?&nbsp; And who will take the pains to contribute to the
lasting of any Empire, but he that has the greatest share in the
enjoyments of it?</p>
<p>Those <i>Popes</i> who at first seemed averse from their
Relations, having in a small time come to know the difficulty of
their own preservation in the hands of Strangers, have
immediately called them to <i>Rome</i>, and thrown themselves
into their Arms, as a place of Refuge against so many who had an
interest to destroy them; and by all sorts of Favours, sought to
make it their Kindreds Interest to love and take care of
them.</p>
<p>It may be that <i>Urban</i> the Eighth, who lived 23 Years
<i>Pope</i>, had not attained to half that Age, if the
<i>Barberins</i> had not used all imaginable means to prolong his
life; which else would have been plotted against by both Princes
and private persons.&nbsp; But no body durst undertake that which
seemed impossible.&nbsp; And without doubt, the care they took of
him, did exceed the desire he had of living; for old age was
become a burden to him at last.</p>
<p><i>Innocent</i> the Tenth, after the Design of getting the
Kingdom of <i>Naples</i> from the <i>Spaniard</i> was discovered,
stood in perpetual fear, lest, to be revenged, <a
name="page2_16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>they should
plot his death; which it may be they had done, if <i>Donna
Olympia</i> had not taken the care to dress his Meat, and feed
him with her own hands: and in acknowledgment of her kindness, he
would often say to her, <i>Sister</i>, <i>do you take care of
me</i>, <i>and I&rsquo;le take care that the Popedom shall be
yours</i>.</p>
<p><i>Pius</i> the Third, of the Family of <i>Picolomini</i> of
<i>Siena</i>, had not died by poyson, procured him by <i>Pandolfo
Petruccii</i> Tyrant of the said place, if he had had some of his
Relations neer him; whereupon he was forced to trust his life in
Strangers hands, and lose it miserably, before he could see any
of his Kindred about him.</p>
<p>But here some body will say, <i>That indeed it would not be
amiss that the</i> Pope <i>should resign the care of his Person
to his Kindred</i>, <i>but not give them an unlimited Power over
Church and State</i>; <i>That it is fit they do not want
necessaries</i>, <i>but that he should not go about to content
their insatiability</i>.&nbsp; To this we will answer in time and
Place; it is enough for the present to have proved, That they are
the most necessary Instruments of the <i>Popes</i>
preservation.&nbsp; And because the obligation of him that
receives his life from another is infinite, therefore the
<i>Popes</i> do think, that they cannot repay but by infinite
Gifts and Favours.&nbsp; Now we will pass to the third Reason,
which is, The Reason of State.</p>
<p>The State or Politick Government of the Church, is the most
unfortunate and miserable in the World; for it is neither
Commonwealth nor Monarchy: and as an ingenious Prelate said,
<i>It is neither from God nor the Devil</i>.&nbsp; And the causes
of its Misery are divers; but particularly one is, Because the
Supreme Governour always dying without Heirs, there is no <a
name="page2_17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>body left
to take pity of the grievances which are continually
introduc&rsquo;d by the Governours of Provinces who rule as they
please.</p>
<p>Many compare all the Ecclesiastick State to a Town taken by an
Enemy, who being out of hopes to keep it any time falls to
plundering and destroying it, carrying away all that&rsquo;s
good; and leaving to the poor Citizens nothing but the liberty of
venting their complaints: Just so do the Church-men who are in
authority in one <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> life; for foreseeing that
their power is like to expire with him, and be resigned up to his
Successor, they make Hay while the Sun shines, and use all manner
of Extortions and Violences in their respective places for fear
else of departing with their hands empty.&nbsp; And the people
are so far from obtaining redress from those that succeed them,
that they had rather be under the Government of their old
Masters; for the new ones come with intention to do as much, if
not worse, than the others.</p>
<p>In the time of <i>Francesco Maria della Rovere</i>, last Duke
of <i>Urbin</i>, his Creatures seeing him past hopes of having
any Heirs; and that after his death the Estate was like to fall
to the Church, as being a Feife of it, they applyed themselves to
make their advantage by all means; that is, they plunder&rsquo;d
and ruin&rsquo;d it, that they might leave it bare to the
Church-men their Successors.&nbsp; Particularly, when they saw
the Duke languishing in a decrepit Age, they then bestirr&rsquo;d
themselves, and flew about like so many Bees to suck the rest of
the Honey: But he hapning to live longer than they expected they
were at a loss, and had drained all the State so dry; that they
themselves were fain to sit and look upon the desolate condition
<a name="page2_18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>of that
Dukedom without being able to make it worse.</p>
<p>It came thus lean and impoverished into the Church-mens hands,
who, for all they have such good Stomachs, were fain to forbear
eating for the first seven years, till it had gathered a little
flesh again; and then they fell to devouring of it afresh, and
have since continued to do so: no sooner perceiving it to be a
little recruited, but they extenuate it with Taxes, Impositions,
and Extortions.</p>
<p>That which hapned once to the Dutchy of <i>Urbin</i>, happens
often to the whole state of the Church; for as soon as the
Governours, and other subordinate Officers, see the <i>Pope</i>
drawing to his end, and by consequence that their time of getting
is also ready to expire, every new <i>Pope</i> advancing new
Creatures, there is no sort of Violence, Theft, Robbery, or
Extortion that they do not commit in their respective charges:
which they no sooner resign to new Officers, but that they who
come in poor, and must maintain the <i>Decorum</i> of their
places, invent some new way of vexing the poor people, and
enriching themselves; giving afterwards a little respite to the
people to breath in, and by that time the <i>Pope</i> is a dying,
and then they fall on a fresh.</p>
<p>So that it appears that the Popedom being Elective and not
Hereditary, causes all these misfortunes to the State and people;
for this makes every body think of the present, and none of the
future, there being no future amongst Church-men.</p>
<p>But if this inconveniency be great, it would without doubt
prove much more intolerable, if the <i>Pope</i> had no Kindred to
help them in the Government of the State and Church; For though
it seem that a <i>Nipotismo</i> <a name="page2_19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>is directly bent upon its own profit
and advantage: yet for divers reasons and respects they do
preserve many places from ruine, and many Subjects from
oppression.&nbsp; Whereas if the <i>Pope</i> were without them,
he would be forced to trust to a great number of Governours, who
would every one be as greedy, and as absolute as a Nephew; and
Lord it as high with the title of <i>Dominus Dominantium</i>.</p>
<p>The Nephews, who are few in number, take upon them to be both
Shepherds, and Shearers; Treasurers, and Extorters: so that they
suffer no body to grow rich but for them, nor to rise but by
their means and to their profit, nor to take from others except
it be to present them.&nbsp; For woe be to those Ministers of
State, or subordinate Officers, that dare contradict a
Nephew&rsquo;s Will; or do any thing without their Order.</p>
<p>Now this being so, it is evident that it is more easie to
satisfie one mans avidity than a hundreds.&nbsp; If the Nephews
were not, every Prelate, every Bishop, every Abbot, every
Cardinal, would treat the Church as the Jews did our
Saviour&rsquo;s Garments; that is, divide it amongst them: and it
may be, would leave nothing for their Successors; for their
Maximes are indeed to live well themselves, but not to provide
that others may do so too.</p>
<p>The <i>Nipotismo</i> looks upon the Popedom as their own, and
so they have some consideration for a thing in which they pretend
a propriety.&nbsp; When once their Purse is full they let it
breath, and recover its forces.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true that that
seldom falls out; for we have seen the <i>Barbarins</i>, enjoy
the state of the Church for three and twenty years: and yet shew
as much avidity when they were upon the point to leave it, as
when they first entred upon it.</p>
<p><a name="page2_20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Besides this, if <i>Rome</i> were without a
<i>Nipotismo</i>, the Government of the City would be every day
in new hands; every Church-man&rsquo;s ambition being to climbe
up to the top of the Wheel, and supplant him that stands next to
the Soveraign Power.&nbsp; So that the Church would be in one
Pontificate, tossed like a ball from one to the other; and that
most commonly by very unskilful persons: the mystery of
Church-Government being a thing not to be mastered but by those
who stay long in it, and acquire great experience in the
management of affairs.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the State were governed by different Persons
under the Reign of one <i>Pope</i>, it would be a very hard
matter to find out the Author of the Peoples miseries, every one
having his Predecessors actions for an excuse; so that men would
also lose that poor consolation of being able to show their
Tormenters: But it is not so when a <i>Nipotismo</i> governs, for
then as they have the Honour, and Riches; so must they endure the
Reproaches, and Complaints made against their Government, which
the <i>Romans</i> do without mercy, making the air sound and
repeat their murmurs with a thousand Echoes.</p>
<p>These reasons do sometimes prevail upon the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Kindred to make them abstain from doing all
the mischief they would do; or at least they suffer not others to
commit crimes and faults which they know will be laid to their
charge: and of the imputation of which they shall be sure to be
heirs as well as of their Uncle&rsquo;s riches.</p>
<p>And indeed, how would it be possible for the State of the
Church, which is a Monarchy, to be governed well if it were
governed as a Republick.&nbsp; For in Commonwealths the
Governours are the Citizens <a name="page2_21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>and Natives themselves, who being
sure that the State they govern, is their own, do administer with
Justice and Equity; first, as reaping a benefit by their
moderation; And secondly, as being sure to expect a punishment
when they are out of their charges: But the <i>Pope</i> having
the disposing of all places and charges, does often advance
Strangers; who have no design but of making their own Fortune,
and who, when once removed from their dignities, may either leave
the State, or else procure impunity by a part of those riches
which they have extorted from the poor people.&nbsp; It is much
better therefore that there should be a <i>Nipotismo</i>, into
whose hands the <i>Popes</i> may trust their Government and
Person; and who by the purchase which they make of great Estates
do, as it were, settle themselves within the State: and may fear
the being called to an account for their violences, if they
exceed measure.</p>
<p>There are three other reasons which seem to conclude very
strongly in favour of a <i>Nipotismo</i>, which are these:</p>
<p>That the <i>Pope</i> may more easily discover the interests of
Foreign Princes; That he may be able to govern with more care and
affection; And that he may be able to carry on the Negotiations
of his Court with more secrecy.</p>
<p>And indeed, it would not only be difficult, but almost
impossible for the <i>Pope</i> to dive into the hidden interests
and designs of Foreign Princes without a <i>Nipotismo</i>; For
how could he trust Strangers with his secrets, if he could not be
assured that they would reciprocally reveal to him all
theirs.&nbsp; The Ministers of State would be easily corrupted to
betray the <i>Pope</i> their Master, and incline much more to
oblige <a name="page2_22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Princes, upon whom, because of their hereditary and
settled condition, they might relie, than to be faithful to one
who might fail every moment; and with him all their hopes and
expectations.</p>
<p>Besides, the Princes themselves would hardly condescend to
reveal their secrets, and treat of important matters in the Court
of <i>Rome</i>, when they should know and see that they must
confide in strangers, whom another Prince might bribe and corrupt
to their disadvantage; For just so far do Soveraigns trust the
<i>Pope</i> as they see about him people, in whom he may trust
himself.</p>
<p><i>Urban</i> the eighth deserves no small praises for his
Policy, all along his Reign: but particularly, for his method and
way of treating with the Soveraigns of <i>Europe</i>; whose
secrets were all revealed to him, whereas none of his were
revealed to them again.&nbsp; For the same means, which he used
to discover others designs, help him to conceal his own.</p>
<p>For having created his two Nephews Cardinals, and gave them
instructions worthy such a politick head as his was, he made one
of them declare for <i>Spain</i>, and the other for
<i>France</i>; each of them making demonstration of an
extraordinary kindness for the Crown they protected.&nbsp; Which
thing proved most fortunate to the <i>Pope</i>, and successful in
the design he had, to be Master of the secrets of both Kings.</p>
<p>Now that this was a design of the Uncle, and no particular
inclination of the Nephews, appears easily; because that Cardinal
<i>Antonio</i>, who sided with the French, had never had any
communication with this Nation before his being made Cardinal:
neither had he received from them any kindness that could endear
him to their Party: Nay, indeed he had <a
name="page2_23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>rather
reason to encline to the Spaniards, from whom he had received
many courtesies worth acknowledging; but he followed in this his
Uncle&rsquo;s suggestions.</p>
<p>The Cardinal <i>Francesco</i> on the other side who had never
any great inclination for <i>Spain</i>, and who in the services
he did do them, did not appear with that violence that Cardinal
<i>Antonio</i> did; for the <i>French</i> would nevertheless in
obedience to his Uncle often declare for them: and in some
occasions show a great deal of affection and desire to oblige a
Crown, which did seek after his protection.</p>
<p><i>Urban</i> having thus assigned the care of the interest of
these two Potent Princes to his Nephews, could not chuse but be
perfectly informed of their designs, and secret intrigues of
their Courts; whose Ministers and Ambassadours in order to a
further discovery of the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> inclinations, were
forced to communicate before hand a great part of their secrets
to the Cardinal, Protector of their Kingdom, in hopes by his
means of diving further into that which was yet hidden to them:
but most commonly they got little light and intelligence by it,
for the Nephews following exactly their Uncle&rsquo;s
Instructions, did endeavour to pump every body else, and keep
themselves close.&nbsp; Their Uncle in the mean time well
informed on both hands, was sure to take just measures; and by an
even carriage so to entertain the affections of both Kings, as to
make them both his Friends: and really one who could govern a
Popedom so well, and easily, betwixt so opposed and different
Interests, did deserve to govern as long as <i>Urban</i> did.</p>
<p><a name="page2_24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span><i>Innocentius</i> might have been named for one of the
greatest Politicians in the world, if his Sister-in-law had not
lead him astray; or rather if he had been guilty of an
unparalell&rsquo;d inconstancy in changing so often his
<i>Nipotismo</i>.</p>
<p>For they that were disgraced did immediately reveal to Princes
all the secrets of his Court, and they who came in their room
could never penetrate into the hidden designs of Forreign Courts;
for the Princes of those Kingdoms and States durst not trust them
with any thing, as being alwayes afraid, lest they should be
turned off as the first.</p>
<p>And in effect, as soon as the news of the adoption of Cardinal
<i>Astalli</i> was spread abroad, there were many that laid great
wagers, that he would not conserve himself in his post long; and
the grounds they went upon, was the unconstant humour of the
Pope, which no body could trust to.</p>
<p>Cardinal <i>Mazarine</i> himself being weary of so many
extravagant changes in the <i>Nipotismo</i> of
<i>Innocentius</i>, and seeing <i>Astalli</i> fallen out of his
favour, and the <i>Barberins</i> in his place, said to one of his
Confidents, in the presence of a French Protestant, these words,
<i>I have never relyed much upon the Cardinal</i> Astalli; <i>and
I shall now scarce rely upon the Pope himself</i>.&nbsp; Many
Princes both of <i>Italy</i> and <i>Germany</i> were of Cardinal
<i>Mazarine&rsquo;s</i> minde in this, and became very cautious
in all their negotiations; avoiding all occasions of treating
with his Holiness, as knowing that nothing could be well managed
in such divisions, and changes.</p>
<p>Thus we see, that not only the <i>Popes</i> must have near
them those that have the title of Nephews; but they must be
really such, as by consanguinity <a name="page2_25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>may be obliged to the same interest
with the <i>Pope</i>, if he means that others should trust
them.&nbsp; This is the only way to make the <i>Popes</i> appear
Sovereigns, as really they desire to be; and any other way they
will seem rather to be the Heads of a Commonwealth than absolute
Princes.</p>
<p>It is fit therefore, that they should be allowed a
<i>Nipotismo</i> for their own and others safety; but it is not
just that they should so indulge this <i>Nipotismo</i>, as to set
it above themselves, and become its slaves.&nbsp; Let them treat
with Princes, but let them not become so themselves, and usurp
the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Authority, so far as to use it without
his knowledge, and often contrary to the Interests of the Church
and State.</p>
<p>Let them not do as <i>Gregory</i> the 15th. who had given to
the Cardinal <i>Ludovisio</i> his Nephew, so great an Authority
of doing and saying what he pleased, without so much as
consulting his Uncle, that he was really become <i>Pope</i>, and
the <i>Pope</i> as if he had been the Nephew; and if ever he come
and give him part of any secret negotiation, it was because the
thing was so intricate, that he either could not, or durst not
undertake to come to execution, without being first fortified
with his Uncle&rsquo;s advice and approbation.</p>
<p>But the best was, that the <i>Pope</i> himself did not dare to
ask him any questions about business, or inform himself
otherwise; but sometimes would be whole weeks together without so
much as seeing the face of an Ambassadour, or publick Minister:
his Nephew in the mean time giving Audience, and concluding all
business with them.</p>
<p>And the <i>Pope</i> was so customed to this usage, that <a
name="page2_26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>it never
came into his minde to be offended at it; but would very
contentedly make amends for those faults which his Nephew did
often commit in his administration: and whensoever he did see his
Nephew come into his presence, he would say, <i>Nephew</i>, <i>I
am sure &rsquo;tis some very hard and intricate business that
brings you hither</i>, <i>for else we should scarce be repaired
to for counsel</i>.&nbsp; And he had a great deal of reason to
say so, for his Nephew did never communicate to him any
negotiation, except he had first spoiled it, and brought himself
to a <i>non-plus</i>; and then the <i>Pope</i> would oblige the
Congregations of the Cardinals to take the business into their
care, and set right again that which had been spoiled by his
inability.</p>
<p>The second reason for the <i>Nipotismo</i> is, that the
<i>Popes</i> may be able to govern with more care and
affection.&nbsp; There is nothing that forces more a Prince to
answer the ends of Government, and to oblige his people, than
when he considers that the Government is to descend to his Heirs;
for a Prince without a Successor does often dissipate and spoil
that which he would preserve, if he had any body to leave it
to.</p>
<p>The State of <i>Venice</i> which never established any Law
without having first deliberated upon it, and sifted it in their
Council of <i>Pregadi</i>, does think fit to oblige the kindred
of the dead Duke to answer for their Kinsman&rsquo;s
misdemeanours and miscarriages; fining them in great summes of
money for a reparation of his faults: so that often they are fain
to endure for the dead Duke those punishments, which his Dignity
when he was alive, and his death, have preserved him from.</p>
<p><a name="page2_27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>The
effect of this is, that the Dukes of <i>Venice</i> do comport
themselves with all moderation and equity, following exactly
those rules of Government which they receive from the State; And
the fear they are in of leaving their Relations engaged in a
painful satisfaction for their faults, does oblige them to study
night and day how they may serve the publick: in doing which,
they do at the same time oblige their Countrey, themselves, and
their Kindred; whereas else they might be subject to follow their
own private interests, to the prejudice and detriment of all the
Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The <i>Popes</i> have almost the same fear upon them, and by
consequent the like obligation; for the only consideration of
leaving their Relations engaged with too powerful enemies, has
often made them desist from enterprizes, which would have proved
fatal to their State, and all Christendom.</p>
<p><i>Urban</i> the 8th. did often protest, that if it had not
been out of a kindeness to his Nephews, he would either have
hazarded the Popedom, or have brought Princes to his will.</p>
<p>The <i>Popes</i> know very well by experience, that there is
no way to preserve their <i>Nipotismo</i> from the persecution
which ordinarily they are to expect from their Successours;
whensoever their Successors are such as come with pre-occupation
against them, and finde in the Government of the Church and State
so many abuses, which do quicken their indignation against the
precedent <i>Nipotismo</i>.</p>
<p>This is a very great tye upon them in their administration,
which appears if once they come to cast it off.</p>
<p><i>Paul</i> the 4th. who had much of a barbarous and <a
name="page2_28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>inhumane
humour in him, more becoming a Souldier than a Pope; as soon as
he had banished his Nephew from <i>Rome</i>, did do things with a
great deal more resolution and insolence than before: insomuch
that it seemed, as if he had a minde to reduce all the world
under his Laws, and force Christendom to follow the dictates of
his <i>Capriccio</i>.</p>
<p>The Ministers of Princes who had to do with him, did extremely
complain of this his proceeding; for he did no less than threaten
them all upon every occasion: and one day particularly as the
Spanish Ambassador was complaining to him of some occasion of
disgust which his Holiness had given the Crown of <i>Spain</i>,
he answered him in a fume, <i>That he had now no Nephews to care
for</i>; <i>and that suppos&rsquo;d</i>, <i>That his actions did
deserve to be blamed</i>, <i>he little cared</i>: <i>for with his
death all resentments would vanish</i>: meaning he was no longer
concerned for his Relations, for whose sake he had all this while
contained himself within the limits of the Papal Dignity.</p>
<p>Some say that <i>Julius</i> the second did bear a great
affection to his Kindred, but did forbear any demonstrations of
kindeness to them out of a more solid Principle of Love; which
was, That they might not receive any reproaches or injuries after
his death, for those faults which he might have committed in his
life time: for having resolved to do nothing but make War, and
lead a Souldiers life, as indeed he did, he would infallibly have
drawn the revenge of all his Enemies upon his kindred, to whom
therefore he shewed himself averse.</p>
<p>And indeed it was wisely done of him, and kindely; <a
name="page2_29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>for it was
impossible but so warlike a humour as his was, must needs offend
many Princes, who all would have been revenged upon his
<i>Nipotismo</i>, as Authors, and Partakers of their
Uncle&rsquo;s Designs.</p>
<p>If <i>Urban</i> had done the same thing, the persecution of
the <i>Barberins</i> had not been at all, or at least had not
been so violent; but the great Authority with which they appeared
under him, did make Princes believe that all the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> actions were of their plotting and
managing.</p>
<p>So, when the Duke of <i>Parma</i>, and the Princes his allyes
made War against the Church, they declared to all the world that
they had no design to offend the <i>Pope</i>; but only to be
revenged of the <i>Barberins</i>, whose ambition they accused as
the Motive of the War.</p>
<p>Quite contrary, All the errors and miscarriages of
<i>Innocent</i> the 10th. were never imputed to his Nephew the
Prince <i>Pamphilio</i>; for every body knew well, that he had no
share in the administration of the Government, and yet he is in
possession of all those riches and vast summes of money which
<i>Donna Olympia</i> his Mother had got together: and no doubt if
she were now alive, she would certainly be in very great danger,
if it were only, because of that opinion which Princes had
conceived of the Authority with which she rul&rsquo;d, and was
thought to have a hand in all the transactions of her
Brother&rsquo;s Pontificate.</p>
<p>And on the other side, that tender affection which the Pope
did bear to his Sister-in-law, was very useful towards the
abating something of the violence of the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i>
temper, diverting him from <a name="page2_30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>all thoughts of War, and keeping him
from entring into Leagues and Confederacies with Princes, with
whom he desired to live in peace.</p>
<p>When the revolution of <i>Naples</i> happened, which was the
greatest occasion that ever any <i>Pope</i> had to possess
himself of that Kingdom, he was so far from attempting it, that
he would never so much as say a word, or enter into deliberation
about it; not that he wanted courage or desire: but only because
he would not leave <i>Donna Olympia</i>, and his Kindred,
involved in an irreconcilable War with <i>Spain</i>, and in
danger of ruining themselves for ever.</p>
<p>Our <i>Alexander</i> has alwayes used the same precautions,
for when <i>Don Agostino</i> in the heighth of his insolence and
pride disobliged so openly the Family of <i>Colonna</i>, by
making his Uncle the Cavalier <i>De la Ciaia</i> take up that
place in the Theatre, which the High Constable <i>Colonna</i> had
hired for himself.</p>
<p>The <i>Pope</i> was infinitely offended at so rash an action,
not out of any consideration for the merit of the Family of the
<i>Colonna</i>; but because he knew that such an accident could
not choose but be followed by an open enmity betwixt the two
Families of <i>Chiggi</i> and <i>Colonna</i>: therefore without
any delay the <i>Pope</i> gave order, that all the means of
reconciliation should be sought out.&nbsp; And finding that
<i>Don Agostino</i> stood too much upon his terms, and would not
be brought to make any satisfaction to the Constable, the
<i>Pope</i> grew passionate; and sending for him, forced him to a
present complyance, using some reproaches: and amongst others,
these words, <i>You commit extravagant follies</i>, <i>and I
</i><a name="page2_31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span><i>must be put to the trouble of making amends for
them</i>, <i>to free you from the danger of their
consequences</i>.&nbsp; And a little after, <i>You do nothing but
procure mischief to your self and me</i>, <i>while I make it my
business to do you good</i>.</p>
<p>I will not say any thing of the business of the Duke of
<i>Crequy</i>, for it is most certain, that without the
consideration of his Kindred, the <i>Pope</i> had never
condescended to an agreement so advantageous for
<i>France</i>.</p>
<p>Witness the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> own expressions to those
Ambassadours and Cardinals, who for the quiet of <i>Italy</i> did
endeavour to take up the business.&nbsp; The Venetian Ambassadour
above all did concern himself very much in the business,
following the Orders of his Senate; which does wisely fore-see
and endeavour to take away all causes of a War in <i>Italy</i>:
and as he was pressing the <i>Pope</i> upon the business, his
Holiness answered him, <i>That it was a great affliction to him
that he had introduced his Kindred into</i> Rome; <i>for else he
would either have broke himself</i>, <i>or have made</i> France
<i>bend</i>.</p>
<p>But the Ambassadour who was very ready in all occasions, but
particularly prepared upon this, answered him, <i>If your
Holiness had never brought your Kindred into</i> Rome, <i>this
accident had not happened</i>.</p>
<p>To which the <i>Pope</i> replyed suddenly, <i>Well then</i>,
<i>we must make all well again</i>, <i>to the Churches
prejudice</i>, <i>and our Kindreds advantage</i>.</p>
<p>The like discourse he had with <i>Monsignor Rasponi</i> (who
now is Cardinal) and was then created Plenipotentiary for the
Treaty of <i>Pisa</i>, after he had in vain been sent to
<i>Lyons</i>, to make an agreement; <a name="page2_32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>for there the business was crossed
with a thousand difficulties, amongst which the precedency was
one.</p>
<p>The <i>Pope</i> was brought into such a Labyrinth, that he did
almost lose his wits in seeking how to come out of it; for on one
side the affection of his Family did continually solicite him to
yield to the great pretensions of the French King; on the other,
the <i>Decorum</i> and honour of his Pontificate, which would be
blurr&rsquo;d with the infamy of having given away so much of the
Dignity and Profits of the Church, did make him resolve to be
constant, and bate nothing of that respect and Majesty which the
<i>Popes</i> do use to expect from Princes: and the rather,
because he had alwayes shewed himself a singular defender of the
Pontifical Dignity, and could not endure to be forced to submit
to a Crown for which he had never had any great inclination.</p>
<p>For all this, at last, the interest of his Kindred carried it
before those of the Church; and after he had worn out all the
slights and arts that the Court of <i>Rome</i> could furnish him
withal, he was forced at last to come to an agreement, as
infamous for the See of <i>Rome</i>, as it was honourable for
<i>France</i>.</p>
<p>Whereupon some of the most zealous Cardinals having vented
their complaints in the Consistory it self, blaming <i>Monsignor
Rasponi</i> for signing the Treaty, He was obliged to excuse
himself to every one of them in a particular Visit, by saying
<i>That he had an express Order from his Holiness for what he had
done</i>; <i>who had declared his resolution of yielding to any
conditions</i>, <i>rather than of leaving his Family engaged
against so powerful an Enemy as France</i>.&nbsp; To which
purpose he related to some of his particular <a
name="page2_33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>friends,
the very words which the <i>Pope</i> spoke to him when he went to
take his leave of him to go to <i>Pisa</i>, to treat with the
Duke of <i>Crequy</i>, which were these, <i>Be discreet and yield
up something of the Popedom</i>, <i>to save our Family</i>;
<i>and not leave them and the Church in an obligation of
maintaining a dangerous War in</i> Italy.</p>
<p>Thus it appears that it is not so much that universal care of
a Father, that makes the <i>Popes</i> maintain a good
correspondence with Christian Princes; as the fear of leaving
Enemies to their Families, and bringing ruine upon their
Relations.</p>
<p>We all know that every <i>Pope</i> either out of envy or some
other motive is well pleased to lessen, if not utterly to destroy
the Family of his Predecessor; and of this we have had many
experiences since two ages.&nbsp; Therefore also the
<i>Popes</i>, to prevent this misfortune, do ordinarily endeavour
to get, while they are alive, the protection of some eminent
Christian Prince, for their Family; under whose wings they may
shelter themselves in a time of calamity.</p>
<p>And if this be, we may conclude, that all the affection, the
care, and the desire which the <i>Popes</i> have of advancing
their Kindred, does at last turn to a general benefit and profit
for Christendom; and if you except one inconvenience, which is,
that they impoverish the Church, and carry away all its treasure,
it were and is better for all other considerations, that the
<i>Popes</i> do govern conjoyntly with their <i>Nipotismo</i>,
than without it: which is proved by a third reason; which is,
that without a <i>Nipotismo</i> the Negotiations and business of
the Court could never be carried with secresie enough.</p>
<p><a name="page2_34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>I am
in doubt whether it be harder to keep a thing secret in the Court
of a Prince, than in the Council of a Commonwealth; for in the
Commonwealth the great number of Counsellors make the keeping of
a Secret a very difficult thing: and in the Court of Princes, the
envy of those Courtiers, who are excluded from the management of
Affairs, is so sharp-sighted, and does so pry and penetrate into
the most hidden Mysteries of the Court, to the end they may
either hurt the Prince through his Counsellors, or the
Counsellors through the Prince, that it is almost impossible to
keep any thing hidden from them.</p>
<p>I am of opinion, that for one reason the Secrets of a
Commonwealth are better concealed, which is; because that those
that are conscious to them, are themselves the Princes and
Masters of the State: but in a Monarchy, the Prince being forced
to trust some of his Subjects, it is much more dangerous for him
and for his business; for he becomes slave and dependent of those
who should be his.&nbsp; Divers Histories will furnish us with
examples to prove what we say; and if that be true, and that yet
nevertheless it is very hard to keep counsel in a Commonwealth,
it is easily inferr&rsquo;d, how difficult a thing it is to do it
in a Monarchy.</p>
<p>But what shall we say then of the state of the Church, of
which no body can tell whether it be Commonwealth, or Monarchy,
the <i>Popes</i> appearing sometimes absolute like Princes, and
other while dependent like Dukes of Commonwealths; and without
doubt the <i>Popes</i> could never be able to conceal so many
private and publick interests without that trust and relyance,
which they have in <a name="page2_35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>their <i>Nipotismo</i>: and this
particularly for two reasons.&nbsp; The first is thus.</p>
<p>The Court of <i>Rome</i> taken in all its latitude, is without
doubt the greatest of <i>Europe</i>, and the most magnificent of
Christendom; for it yields to no other in the great number of
Ambassadours, and publick Ministers which reside in it.</p>
<p>For the <i>Popes</i>, that they may the better conserve the
title of Universal Father, which they affect, do by all means
procure to have as many Ambassadors of Christian Princes near
them as they can.&nbsp; But that very thing by which this Court
seems to be most honoured, does also carry with it an evident
danger; for these Ambassadours and Residents being unwilling to
stay in <i>Rome</i>, without procuring some considerable
advantage to the Princes that send them, are perpetually watching
for occasions to discover the <i>Popes</i> most secret designs:
so that they are in effect so many spyes, who the more they are
in number, the more do they encrease the difficulty of preserving
and concealing the Secrets of the Court.</p>
<p>Before I speak of the second Reason, which makes the Court of
<i>Rome</i> so suspicious a place for Secrets, I must say
something about the Cardinals, and their Office, and
Employment.</p>
<p>The Cardinals are the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Counsellors, who by
the Dignity of their place, and the Majesty of their Habit, do
much augment the pomp and splendor of the Court.&nbsp; The
<i>Popes</i> do every day give them new Priviledges and
Prerogatives, by the means of which they are respected like so
many Kings.</p>
<p>This makes Forreign Princes endeavour to get <a
name="page2_36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>their
friendship by all means, giving them both secret and publick
allowances and Pensions, in consideration of these Prerogatives,
and of the power which they have to chuse the <i>Pope</i>; who
must necessarily be one of their number.</p>
<p>But if Princes shew a promptitude and readiness to win the
Cardinals affections, they are themselves reciprocally courted by
the Cardinals for divers reasons; As first, for the Emolument of
their Pensions; Next, that they may not obstruct their way to the
Popedom by an open Exclusion in the Conclave; And last of all,
that they may live in greater reputation and esteem in
<i>Rome</i>, Where those Cardinals are most valued that entertain
an exact correspondence with Princes: particularly if it be with
any of the two Crowns of <i>Europe</i>, that is, <i>France</i>,
or <i>Spain</i>; upon whose Brigues and Interests does ordinarily
depend the election of the <i>Pope</i>.</p>
<p>Now it is to be believed, that these Princes do not prodigally
spend their Treasure without receiving a continual Interest for
it; which Interest is an exact information of all that is done,
treated, and managed in the Court of <i>Rome</i>: And of this the
Cardinals acquit themselves with great industry and
diligence.</p>
<p>So we see, how intricate and troublesome the Government of
<i>Rome</i> would become to the <i>Popes</i>; if they had not
Confidents, that is, Nephews, on whom they might relie; and to
whom they might trust their secrets without fear.</p>
<p>For indeed, a <i>Pope</i> without Kindred must renounce
Monarchy, and resolve to be only as the Head of a Commonwealth;
which would be just to give himself up into the hands of the
Cardinals, and be at their discretion: Which if it were, every
body may <a name="page2_37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>easily infer how dangerous it would prove to the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Authority, and how unbeseeming the greatness
and <i>decorum</i> of his place and dignity.&nbsp; Besides that,
probably things would fall into confusion and disorder, while
every Cardinal would be more intent to satisfie his own ends;
and, as they say, draw the water to his Mill, than to mind the
necessities of the State and Church.</p>
<p>If the <i>Pope</i> could do nothing without the counsel and
assent of the Cardinals, How would he be able to treat any
Leagues, make Wars, or Peace?&nbsp; Which are things so incident
to the nature of a great State, such as the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i>
is, that it can seldom be without them.&nbsp; There would be
framed a thousand difficulties in the very beginnings of
Negotiations; and the Enemy would know all before you had
resolved any thing.&nbsp; Every Cardinal would support his Prince
and Country, and at last they would all be so embarassed and
confounded, that they would either be in danger of losing
themselves for the Church, or of exposing the Church to mischief
to save themselves.</p>
<p>How would it be fit, that the <i>Pope</i> should advise with
the Senate of Cardinals, if they themselves are his and the
Churches greatest enemies, If they have not only promised, but
sworn fidelity to the Party of those Princes that give them
Pensions and Revenues?&nbsp; How then can they follow the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> directions, or consent to his designs?&nbsp;
Certainly they must either cheat the Prince, that they may be
true to the Church; or be false to the Church, that they may not
be ungrateful to those Princes, whose money they have taken.</p>
<p>There are some Cardinals that would not care, if all <a
name="page2_38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>were lost,
so they did but save their Family, which is under the protection
of some Prince; and avoid themselves the reproach of ingratitude
from their Benefactors.</p>
<p>The greatest part of the Cardinals are either of the
<i>French</i> or <i>Spanish</i> Faction, and each of them makes
it his greatest glory to defend the Pretensions of the Crown he
protects, whether just or unjust; so that often between them they
neglect and ruine the Interests of the Church and
<i>Pope</i>.&nbsp; How were it possible then for the <i>Pope</i>
either to preserve himself or the Church in its Prerogatives, if
he would take and follow the counsel of those whose interest
makes them the Enemies to both; though they pretend, that what
they do is only out of a tender consideration of the publick
good.</p>
<p>To this purpose I remember that a certain <i>Italian</i>
Cardinal, being weary of holding for many years on the
<i>Spaniards</i> side, gave himself to the <i>French</i> by the
mediation of a better Pension which they promised him.&nbsp; And
indeed the Cardinals, whatsoever they pretend, have no other
inclination to either party than what their Interest leads them
to; For he that gives highest Pensions, and the best Benefices,
is sure to have them.</p>
<p>This Cardinal, having thus renounced the <i>Spaniard</i>, did
go about to take away the imputation of inconstancy and
self-interest; and would say in all companies, <i>That he had no
other end in doing so</i>, <i>but a desire to be able to serve
the Church and</i> Pope <i>the better</i>.</p>
<p>But another Cardinal, of great experience and prudence,
hearing him one day discourse after this rate, could not forbear
saying these words to him, <i>I wish to </i><a
name="page2_39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span><i>God that
your Eminence</i>, <i>that have never been able to do the Church
any service while you were a true</i> Spaniard, <i>may do her
some now you are a counterfeit</i> Frenchman.&nbsp; And this he
said in the presence of divers Cardinals and Embassadours.</p>
<p>Let us then conclude, that the State and Church can never be
well governed, as to the point in hand, if the <i>Popes</i> be
without Nephews to relye on, and in whose secrecy they may
confide.</p>
<p><i>Innocentius</i> the tenth was so convinced of this truth,
that finding himself deprived of those helps which he could not
receive from his lawful Kindred by reason of their inabilities;
and withal seeing that he was exposed to the unsatiable avarice
of a woman, his Sister-in-Law, he was fain to take the young
<i>Astalli</i> and declare him Cardinal Nephew, and
<i>Padrone</i>, giving him the name of <i>Pamphilio</i>; and in a
word, made him in <i>Rome</i>, as <i>Pharaoh</i> was in
<i>&AElig;gypt</i>, the Governour of all things.</p>
<p>But what hapned?&nbsp; This young Cardinal not being able to
comply with the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> humours, and having no tye of
Consanguinity upon him, was rather a Traytor to him than a
Nephew; for he did reveal to the <i>Spaniards</i>, from whom he
did secretly receive good Pension, all that passed through his
hands, or that could come to his knowledge: caring not how he
hazarded and engaged the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Honour and
Reputation.</p>
<p>Particularly, at that time that the <i>Pope</i> and the
<i>Barberins</i> together, did consult how they should fall upon
the Kingdom of <i>Naples</i> and divide it among themselves,
<i>Astalli</i> all day long did set spies, and endeavour himself
to discover their Counsels; and then secretly in the night did
give the <i>Spaniards</i> notice of <a name="page2_40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>all; who, being thus well instructed,
did easily prevent their Enemies designs, by taking away all
those means which the Pretendants relied upon for the execution
of their Enterprize.</p>
<p>Upon this the <i>Pope</i> enraged against <i>Astalli</i>,
banished him from <i>Rome</i>, took away from him all that he had
so liberally given him, except the quality of Cardinal; of which
he could not be deprived but for great crimes, and that by a fair
trial too.</p>
<p>Now if the <i>Pope Innocent</i> could not trust one whom he
had raised from nothing; and if the secrets of his Court were
revealed and published by a Cardinal so much obliged to him, How
can other <i>Popes</i> trust Cardinals that are as it were their
enemies by being too much other Princes friends?</p>
<p>These are the reasons that force the <i>Popes</i> to call
their Kindred about them, and shew them all demonstrations of
kindness; and I think they are such as prove that the <i>Pope</i>
cannot govern according to the rules of good Policy, if their
Kindred be not with them, and have not a share in their
fortune.</p>
<p>And if it be so, Why do we murmur so much against the
<i>Popes</i> for spending the Treasure of the Church in
maintaining the greatness of their Nephews? since it is certain
that their Pomp and State is the Churches.&nbsp; And to what
shall its Treasure be useful, except it serve to make the Majesty
of the Popedom appear to the eyes of the world?&nbsp; For there
is no doubt, that if the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Spiritual Authority
were not held up and maintained by his Temporal Power, it would
soon be ruined and despised.&nbsp; For now adaies the reputation
of riches and strength is that, which breeds respect for the
Popedom; as in the <a name="page2_41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Primitive Ages of the Church it was
upheld by holiness of life, and good example.</p>
<p>Poor Church-men are indeed respected still by some devout
Women, and the Vulgar: But they are despised in the Courts of
Princes; where the Rich are welcome, and honourably
received.&nbsp; A poor Church-man must wear a Hair-cloth, Fast,
do Penitence, and work Miracles to be known and respected: But a
rich one, without more ado, shall immediately be saluted and
welcomed even where he is unknown.</p>
<p>Why are the Jesuites so in vogue in the World, and desired in
Courts, as if Princes could not be without them.&nbsp; The Vulgar
adore them, Noblemen respect them, and Magistrates grant them
protection and priviledges.&nbsp; Is it that they serve the
Church better than other Church-men?&nbsp; No certainly: For the
Orders of Saint <i>Francis</i> and Saint <i>Dominick</i> have
spent more bloud in the profession of the Christian Faith in a
Day, than the Jesuites in an Age; neither do they live a more
exemplary or a stricter life than others.&nbsp; How comes it to
pass then, that they are so powerful?&nbsp; I will tell you;
Money is the Key which opens all doors to these good Fathers, by
which they purchase Credit, Power, and Authority, even amongst
Church-men, and in the Court of <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Popes</i> by this, seeing how important a thing Riches
are in the hands of Church-men, do very wisely strive to furnish
their <i>Nipotismo</i> with them; that as they are to treat and
manage the greatest affairs of Christendom: so they may do it
with the Pompe and State, that so Eminent an Employment does
require.</p>

Rome <i>in the time of</i> Paul <i>the Fourth</i>.&nbsp; <i>Of
the Cardinal</i> Caraffa <i>that died last</i>: <i>And of some
other Particularities about other</i> Popes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> which we have said in the
precedent Book, is rather a Panegyrick for the <i>Popes</i> and
their Nephews, than a true dis-interessed Relation, becoming a
History: Therefore lest our <i>Nipotismo</i> should lose its
Soul, and that which will make it live, we must fall into our
wonted indifference; and by saying all the ill, and all the good
that can be said of the <i>Nipotismo</i>, perswade our Reader, as
it is true, That we have no other Design, than to relate freely
and without interest its concerns.</p>
<p>Thus doing, the <i>Popes</i> will have no reason to complain;
since the ill that is said, will be recompensed by the good; and
the <i>Romans</i>, or my other Readers, will not tax the Author
of partiality or flattery, since he so freely writes all that
comes to his knowledge for the instruction of the Publick.</p>
<p>Therefore we will treat in this Book, of all the good and all
the mischief, that the Nephews of the <i>Popes</i> have done to
the Church, ever since <i>Sixtus</i> the Fourth.&nbsp; Their good
actions shall be set out, that the Memory of the dead may be
revived, and due Honour given to the living that deserve
it.&nbsp; And their ill deeds shall not be forgotten, that they
may be hated by all Mankind; and that the Nephews of the
<i>Popes</i> to come, hearing the blame they undergo, may learn
to esteem good actions, and avoid ill ones.</p>
<p>But the greatest difficulty that I find in the execution of
this my design, will be, how to separate the good Corn from the
Tares: for all that the <i>Nipotismo</i> <a
name="page2_47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>does, is
thought good and just by them, though never so wicked; and the
<i>Romans</i>, on the contrary, will scarce allow of any of their
actions, though never so virtuous.</p>
<p>Christ has often compared in his Gospel the Church to a Field;
and indeed it was a very fit Metaphor: for, like a Field, it has
always been either sowed, or mowed; and it is a hard matter to
know, whether the number of the Sowers does exceed that of the
Mowers, though their Employment be very different.</p>
<p>But certainly we may say, That the <i>Popes</i> Nephews have
always been the Mowers, and the rest of Christian Princes the
Sowers.&nbsp; And as Princes have made no difficulty of taxing
themselves and their Subjects, and parting with the dearest
fruits of their labours, to give to the Church; so the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Nephews have made no scruple of dissipating
and spending in their Pastimes and Pleasures, that which Princes
had spared out of their own Treasure for them.</p>
<p>What would <i>Constantine</i>, <i>Pepin</i>,
<i>Charlemagne</i>, the Countess <i>Mathilda</i>, and so many
other Princes say, if they should come into the World again, to
see those Lands and Revenues, which they so charitably gave to
the Church, divided, and cast lots for, as his Vestments?&nbsp;
Truly I think, that they would now think it as a pious Work, to
take from the Church-men by force, that which they had before
given so willingly: and this because they would deliver so many
People from the intolerable oppression of these
<i>Nipotismo&rsquo;s</i>.&nbsp; And indeed their insatiability is
such, that the Church and the State, ruined and spoiled as it is
by so many hungry <i>Nipotismo&rsquo;s</i>, would scarce <a
name="page2_48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>suffice for
their maintenance, if Forreign Princes did not take a pride in
enriching the Church by great Revenues, which are all devoured by
the hungry <i>Nipotismo&rsquo;s</i>; who are very justly compared
to the <i>Hydra&rsquo;s</i> Heads, whereof one was no sooner cut
off, but there sprung seven worse and more envenomed in the
place.</p>
<p>It is a kind of a Miracle to me, to hear Princes murmur at the
disorders the <i>Nipotismo&rsquo;s</i> commit, in robbing the
Church, and perverting the use of its Riches; And yet to see
those very same Princes contribute out of their own Revenues, and
their Peoples Sweat and Labour, towards the enriching of those
that they blame.</p>
<p>I think it would be as great a piece of Justice to punish
those that are robb&rsquo;d, as to chastise him that commits the
Theft: For if so, the number of Thieves would diminish
infinitely; since every body then would take as much care in
preserving, as the Thief could use Art in stealing.&nbsp; Whereas
now every one relying upon the surety of the Publick Laws, and
the punishment that attends those that violate them, does as it
were give an occasion of offending against them; and as the
Proverb says, <i>The Occasion makes the Thief</i>; which is as
much as to say, That they that are negligent in preserving their
own, are the cause that others have a mind to it.</p>
<p>If Princes following this Truth, did shut up their Treasures,
and stop that Stream of Wealth which flows from their States to
<i>Rome</i>, while they see that it is all ill us&rsquo;d, and
employed to the ruine of the Church and True Religion; certainly
the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Nephews would not commit so many
Scandals: neither would the World have so much reason to murmur
against them.</p>
<p><a name="page2_49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>But
our Complaints are not like to cease, while Princes shall think
it honourable and pious to oppress their Subjects, that they may
supply the Court of <i>Rome</i>: And, on the other side, the
<i>Nipotismo</i> shall make no scruple of taking any thing from
the Church and State, and alledge for their excuse, <i>That they
take nothing but what is the superfluous part of the Churches
Revenue</i>.</p>
<p>What do so many Abbies, Pensions, and other Revenues, which
Princes bestow upon Church-men, serve for; but to weaken so much
their own States, and strengthen another Princes? to make that
which is Sacred, Profane? turn Crosses into Swords, and Humility
into Pride and Majesty?&nbsp; And when they have bestowed thus
their Gifts and Presents upon those that do not need them, they
are not only forsaken in their greatest distress by Church-men;
but are set upon by them, and brought to their ruin, that the
Church may have the Soveraignty over their People, in the Place
of the lawful Princes.</p>
<p>All the disorders and scandals of the Church, State, and
Church-men, take their rise from their Riches.&nbsp; When the
Church was poor, Church-men were holy, having nothing to employ
their minds about, but the Rules of a Good Life: but since once
Riches came amongst them, farewell Holiness of Life; they have
not the leisure; they are too much taken up with telling their
Money, buying and selling Estates and Princedoms; they forget
those spiritual Riches of the Soul, and mind only those that
relate to the Pleasures of the Body.</p>
<p>Riches came in by little and little upon the Church, and by
the same degrees Sanctity and Holiness of Life went out.&nbsp;
They that read the History <a name="page2_50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>of the Church, cannot chuse but have
discerned all along the truth of what I say.</p>
<p>And yet every one knowing this, and being so forward to
complain and murmur against the <i>Popes</i> avarice, and their
Nephews prodigality; no body thinks of blaming those that by
continual Gifts do every day supply and furnish them with these
Instruments of Wickedness.</p>
<p>Christ has declared definitively, and pronounced with his own
mouth, in the sixth Chapter of Saint <i>Matthew</i>, <i>That it
is impossible to serve God and Mammon</i>.&nbsp; Now
<i>Mammon</i> being interpreted Riches by most, nay by all, the
conclusion is, <i>That it is impossible to serve God and
Riches</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Popes</i>, on the other side, do by their continual
practice prove to the World, in enriching their Families, that
they are firmly perswaded, that one may at the same time serve
God, and the <i>Mammon</i> or Riches of this World; or else
certainly they would give over tormenting themselves, to make
their Kindred great.</p>
<p>Riches are that <i>Primum Movens</i> which set the Sphere of
the <i>Nipotismo</i> a going; and we may say, That in this Heaven
of theirs, they are no less devout than poor simple Women are, to
purchase that which is promised them by the Church of<i>
Rome</i>: For as the one falls down before a Crucifix, and adores
the Altar, to gain Indulgences; so do the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i>
Nephews prostrate themselves before their Treasures, and believe
that they obtain the pardon of all their faults, in worshipping
the Coffers in which they have buried the Churches Riches.</p>
<p>Now if Christ has said, <i>That there is no serving God and
Riches</i>, How can the <i>Popes</i> give their Nephews <a
name="page2_51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>leave to
serve Riches and God?&nbsp; Have the <i>Popes</i> the Power of
giving our Saviour the Lie?&nbsp; For what is it else?&nbsp; For
either they believe not Christ&rsquo;s Words to be true, or else
they are resolved to contradict them in their Practice; both
which are abominable to any rational or serious Christian: though
I believe that in <i>Italy</i> there are thousands who, frighted
by the Inquisition, would rather answer, <i>That Christ was
mistaken in his Doctrine</i>, than say, <i>That the</i> Pope
<i>does amiss in his Practice</i>.</p>
<p>About four years ago I was in <i>Bagni del Vall&eacute;</i>, a
Town so called; where, amongst others, was a Father of the Order
of Saint <i>Augustine</i>, by name Father <i>Paolo Segani</i>,
who called himself a Preacher; though for my part I believe he
was so far from being a good Divine, that he was scarce Master of
the Rules of <i>Grammar</i> in the <i>Latin</i> Tongue.</p>
<p>This good Father was one day engaged in a Dispute with a
Protestant Gentleman, about the Infallibility of the <i>Pope</i>;
and there were many of both Religions present, amongst whom I was
one.&nbsp; The <i>Protestant</i> was a <i>Frenchman</i>, called
<i>Jean Antony Guerin</i>, a Doctor of Physick, and a very
ingenious Gentleman; but one who excelled in the knowledge of the
Holy Scripture, and did so well understand all the hard Passages
of it, that the Ministers of his Religion did often take great
pleasure to hear him discourse with so much ability about it.</p>
<p>The Dispute on the Catholick&rsquo;s side was most spent in
Words, he being able to answer to all the Protestant&rsquo;s
Reasons with nothing but a Negative, and say, <i>It is not
true</i>, <i>That is false</i>.</p>
<p>But at last, as they grew warm, the Protestant pressing closer
upon him, put this Question to him, <a name="page2_52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>on purpose because he saw him so
ignorant.&nbsp; <i>Whether or no it were easier for Christ to
have err&rsquo;d in delivering his Gospel</i>, <i>than for
the</i> Pope <i>to erre in his Decrees</i>?</p>
<p>At this the Monk smiled, and thinking to hit the nail on the
head, answer&rsquo;d him boldly, <i>That he believed that
Christ</i>, <i>as Man</i>, <i>might have erred</i>; <i>but that
the</i> Pope, <i>as God</i>, <i>could not erre</i>.</p>
<p>At this Answer the Protestant burst out a laughing, and so did
some <i>Swisser</i> Ladies, who without doubt had more wit and
discernment in matters of Religion, than this impertinent
Monk.&nbsp; And thus the Dispute ceased; the Protestant
contenting himself to have shewed the others Ignorance, and the
Monk thinking he had answer&rsquo;d most invincibly.</p>
<p>And indeed, in what Soul or Mind can this Opinion be
receiv&rsquo;d, That the <i>Pope</i> is more infallible than
Christ; That God should fail in his Words, and a <i>Pope</i> be
infallible in His Decrees?&nbsp; O Blasphemy, and horrible Error
in the poor abus&rsquo;d People! who give more credit to the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> words, than to Christ&rsquo;s own Gospel.</p>
<p>It has been observed, that in the <i>Popes</i> Families there
has been Saints, even amongst their inferiour rank of their
Servants; and yet there never was any of their Nephews
Saints.&nbsp; I have turned over great Volumes of the
Church-History, a purpose to see if amongst that great number of
men, who are said to has performed Miracles, there were any one
of a Nipotismo to be found amongst them: But truly I lost my
pains; for the <i>Popes</i>, who have filled up the <i>Roman</i>
Kalendar with thousands of Saints, have not yet been able to
place one of their Nephews there.&nbsp; And indeed, how is it
possible that they, that live in <a name="page2_53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>delight and greatness, should have
room amongst those that have purchased their place in heaven by
sufferings and poverty?</p>
<p>And me-thinks, it is a sad thing to observe for the Nephews,
that all the harm the Church has received was from those amongst
them that shewed the strongest Propension to Riches and Power:
whereas all the good that has been done by them comes from those
amongst them that have been moderate, and contented with ordinary
riches.&nbsp; And now if we measure the good by these moderate
men, and the ill by the insatiable, the number of the last being
much greater than that of the first, will demonstrate to us that
the damage the Church receives from the <i>Nipotismo</i> is much
greater then the good they ever did or will do to it.</p>
<p>In the time that <i>Urban</i> the eighth Excommunicated the
<i>Lucheses</i> for going about to repress the Insolence of
Church-men in their State; all the <i>Italian</i> Princes sided
with them, not out of any particular affection to them, but out
of a politick reason, they being all concern&rsquo;d in the loss
of <i>Lucca</i>, for thereby the Ecclesiastick State and the
pride of the <i>Nipotismo</i> would have been encreased.&nbsp;
And yet no body for all this durst say any thing against the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Person or Authority, but lay all the fault
upon the <i>Nipotismo</i>; As one day I heard a Senator of
<i>Venice</i> discoursing in these words:</p>
<p><i>Italy has little reason to complain of the</i> Popes,
<i>but it has a great deal to murmur against their
Nephews</i>.&nbsp; Urban <i>would be good and holy if</i>
Francesco Antonio <i>and</i> Tadeo Barberini <i>were not
devils</i>; <i>but as his affection blinds him to them</i>, <i>so
does their pride blind them in their conduct towards
Princes</i>.&nbsp; <i>Because they </i><a
name="page2_54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span><i>have a
Vail drawn over their eyes</i>, <i>they think that all the world
must be one colour</i>.&nbsp; <i>And they are so busied from
morning to night in disposing of that vast Treasure which they
have already gathered</i>, <i>and in inventing new waies to
purchase more</i>, <i>that they think not of getting the favour
of those Princes who will remain such when the</i> Barberins
<i>shall cease to be Lords and Masters</i>.&nbsp; <i>If their
Interest had not so great an Empire over them they would govern
the Church better</i>; <i>and in a word</i>, <i>the Church would
be in them</i>, <i>and not they in the Church</i>.</p>
<p>But what a strange Sacrilegious opinion is that which is
maintained by the Divines of the Church of <i>Rome</i>? viz.
<i>That one who has got his riches by Extortions</i>, <i>and
oppressing of the poor</i>, <i>and any wicked way</i>, <i>is not
obliged to a restitution to the poor</i>: <i>But it is enough if
when he dies he leaves his Estate to some Church</i>, <i>founds a
Monastery</i>, <i>or an Hospital</i>; as if it were lawful to
transgress the Law of God, and bring ones self into a state of
damnation to satisfie that covetous and insatiable humour of the
Church-men.</p>
<p>If the Walls of <i>Rome</i> could speak, and the Fabricks of
so many stately Cloysters had mouths to make themselves heard; if
those vast Palaces of the <i>Nipotismos</i> were animated; Oh!
How many tender-hearted Christians would be fain to forsake the
City, and retire into desarts, that they might not hear the
stones complain for the poor, and lament their misfortune?</p>
<p><i>Ferdinand</i>, Second Duke of <i>Toscany</i>, having a
great deal of reason to complain of the <i>Barberins</i>
proceedings towards him, said one day to one who was about to go
in Pilgrimage to <i>Rome</i>: <i>That the holiest Temple </i><a
name="page2_55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span><i>that he
should see there would be the</i> Barberins <i>Palace</i>, <i>for
that it was cemented and built with the bloud of many
Martyrs</i>.</p>
<p>If any body in <i>Rome</i> should steal but the value of six
pence in his greatest necessity from a Priest, without doubt the
<i>Nipotismo</i>, who has the Government of the City in their
hands, would cause him to be hang&rsquo;d immediately: and yet
they that rob and spoyl the Church go off free, and without any
punishment.</p>
<p>Every day there comes out some new Order from the
Datary-Office for the reformation of the abuses committed by
Church-men in their employments; and the <i>Popes</i> do give
often particular Commissions to This and That Cardinal to enquire
into the lives of the Monks, and take away those Scandals which
do every day encrease: And yet for all this the <i>Romans</i>
observe, that the more the Decrees of Reformation are, the more
are the Vices multiplied; the disease being so stabborn and
inveterate, that it grows worse when the Physician goes about to
apply remedies to it.</p>
<p>The <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> subjects curse the <i>Nipotismo</i>
for their Tyranny and Extortions.&nbsp; Christendom is
scandalized to see that they little believe that Religion of
which they make so great Profession.&nbsp; The Church weeps and
sheds tears to see its bowels gnawn and torn by the
<i>Nipotismo</i>.&nbsp; The State, weakned by so many Taxes and
Oppressions, sends its cries to Heaven against them.&nbsp; The
Monks exclaim, seeing that the <i>Nipotismo&rsquo;s</i> Avarice
deprives them of their Profit, and makes them contribute towards
the maintenance of their Grandeur.&nbsp; Princes and Embassadours
retire discontented from <i>Rome</i>, not being able to endure
the <a name="page2_56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span><i>Nipotismo&rsquo;s</i> insolence.&nbsp; The Altars
themselves are often forsaken and stand empty, the Nephews
refusing to grant Indulgences without money.</p>
<p>Certainly these abuses, these disorders, these scandals should
drive the <i>Popes</i> out of <i>Rome</i>.&nbsp; That Gardener
that does only cut the top of the Weeds, and not root them out,
is but an ill Gardener.&nbsp; But how can the <i>Popes</i> reform
the abuses of the Church, if they do not begin with their
Nephews?&nbsp; For it would also else be a very preposterous
Reformation that should begin with the Effect, and leave the
Cause untouched.&nbsp; Some say, that the <i>Popes</i> are holy
in the Reformations of the Breviary, and the chastizing of the
<i>Romans</i> for their faults: But they are devils in leaving
the crimes of their Nephews unpunished; for they trusting to
their Uncles Indulgence, do slack the Reins, which should curb
the natural inclination which we all have to do ill.</p>
<p>But it is now time to enter into a particular Narration of the
good and hurt the Church has received from the <i>Nipotismo</i>;
and as we begun their History at <i>Sixtus</i> the fourth, and
continued it down to <i>Alexander</i> the seventh now reigning:
So we will now begin at <i>Alexander</i>, and trace it backwards
up to <i>Sixtus</i> the fourth.</p>
<p>The first mischief, and indeed the most considerable one,
caused by the <i>Nipotismo</i> of <i>Alexander</i>, was the
change made by them in the <i>Pope</i>; whom from godly, pious,
and inclin&rsquo;d to mortification, they have made sensual and
ambitious.</p>
<p><i>Alexander</i> in the first months of his elevation to the
Popedom had so taken upon him the profession of an Evangelical
life, that he was wont to season his meat with ashes, to sleep
upon a hard Couch, to <a name="page2_57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>hate Riches, Glory, and Pomp; taking
a great pleasure to give audience to Embassadours in a Chamber
full of dead mens skuls, and in the sight of his Coffin, which
stood there to put him in mind of his death.</p>
<p>The Cardinals, the Princes, the Prelates, the <i>Romans</i>
were all touched with so pious an Example, and did begin to think
of reforming their lives.&nbsp; The Hereticks themselves did bear
that respect to his Holiness, as to prostrate themselves in the
streets, when he went through <i>Rome</i>, not so much in fear of
his Majesty, as in honour of his Vertue.&nbsp; Divers French
Protestants came on purpose to <i>Rome</i> to know whether his
words did answer his reputation, and if he did really lead the
life he was said to lead.&nbsp; The noyse of his Sanctity being
so great in <i>France</i>, that it was almost impossible to
believe all that was said of it.</p>
<p>Thus lived <i>Alexander</i>, while he lived without a
<i>Nipotismo</i>: But no sooner had they set their feet in
<i>Rome</i> but the <i>Pope</i> changed his nature, or rather
came to himself; for instead of Humility, succeeded Vanity; his
Mortification vanished, and his hard Couch, was changed into a
soft Feather-bed; his dead-mens skuls, into so many Jewels; and
his thoughts of death, into eternal designs of Ambition and
Grandeur: Filling up his empty Coffin with Money, as if he had a
design to corrupt death, and purchase life with Riches.</p>
<p>Hereupon a publick Minister, returning from his Audience the
very same day that the <i>Nipotismo</i> came to <i>Rome</i>; and
having felicitated his Holiness upon their arrival, said, as soon
as he came home, to one of his friends these very words: <i>He is
not of the same humour he was wont to be</i>; <i>he was
us&rsquo;d to stand with </i><a name="page2_58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span><i>his eyes fixed upon the
ground</i>, <i>and now he does nothing but fix them upon</i> Don
Agostino; <i>Heretofore we did hear him sigh</i> often, <i>and
now he is as inclined to laugh</i>.&nbsp; <i>I am afraid the</i>
Nipotismo <i>has already spoyled him</i>.</p>
<p>This is the first harm that they have done the Church.&nbsp; I
do not know what good they may do hereafter, but hitherto they
have done so little that it is invisible; whereas the mischief
they are Authors of, is obvious to all eyes.&nbsp; <i>Don
Mario</i>, who is the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Brother, and the Head
of the <i>Nipotismo</i>, does exercise his place of Governour of
<i>Rome</i> with so much Tyranny, that the City it self is become
odious to many Families of quality, who have left and removed to
other Towns, that they might not be any longer subject to one who
gives occasion of complaint to the People, the Gentry, and
Strangers; For he is not only averse from doing curtesies, and
inexorable in punishments; but he is inclin&rsquo;d to disgust
all those who, having to do with him, do not appease his angry
genius with money.</p>
<p>Besides, assuming to himself, in the Government of the
<i>Borgo</i>, a greater Authority than does belong to him of
right, he does, as it were eclipse and stifle the jurisdiction of
the Governour of <i>Rome</i>; who often is forced to own those
faults of which he is innocent, <i>Don Mario</i> laying upon him
all the miscarriages, and taking to himself all the profit of
both places.&nbsp; For proof of this I will bring an example
which will never be forgot by Posterity.</p>
<p>In the time that the Duke of <i>Crequy</i> received that
affront to see his Coach assaulted and fired upon by the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Guards; the <i>Cardinal Imperiale</i>, who
was then Governour of <i>Rome</i>, was so innocent of this
accident, that he did not so much as know of it till <a
name="page2_59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>it was
past, and then he found that <i>Don Mario</i> had so
engag&rsquo;d him in it, that there was no retiring; and indeed
though he have since made a Journey into <i>France</i> to
justifie himself: nevertheless the French Court, who cannot
forget the affront done the King and Nation, can less avoid
remembring of Cardinal <i>Imperiale</i>, who was charged as the
Author of it.</p>
<p>And yet they are very well informed that the design was laid
by <i>Don Mario</i>, and the execution only charged upon Cardinal
<i>Imperiale</i>, who has been fain to endure that humiliation
and punishment which did belong to the other.</p>
<p>Indeed if the <i>Pope</i> had not in good time made
satisfaction for the Injury, the <i>French</i> King was resolved
to seek his reparation by his Sword; not against the <i>Pope</i>,
who knew nothing of the business till after it was brought about;
but against his Brother, who had set <i>Imperiale</i> upon the
execution of it.</p>
<p>But in the reparation, the Church was the most endammaged; for
besides the loss of its honour, and that respect which was wont
to be borne to it, it received a very great blow in its strength
and riches: for not only the <i>Pope&rsquo;s Nuncio</i> was
immediately sent away from the French Court, but also his
Vice-Legat was driven from <i>Avignon</i>, and the Court of
<i>Rome</i> was forced to entertain an Army all the time of the
Treaty, and before, for fear of being surpriz&rsquo;d by the
Kings Forces; and when it did come to an agreement, it was
concluded in a dishonourable and shameful way for <i>Rome</i>,
and for the Church.&nbsp; This is the good and profit that the
Signor <i>Don Mario</i> has brought to the <a
name="page2_60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>Church; and
yet in the Articles of Peace there was little or no mention made
of his person.</p>
<p>The <i>Pope</i>, for all this, is so pre-possessed with a good
opinion of him, that he does give him thereby an occasion, and
almost an invitation of committing more <i>mischief</i>, than he
would do otherwise.</p>
<p>But if <i>Don Mario</i> has been useless, or rather
prejudicial to the Church, certainly <i>Don Agostino</i>, his
Nephew, has been little better: He is one that would seem to be
born to an Empire; and were it <i>Alexander&rsquo;s</i> or
<i>C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s</i> he did enjoy, he would not show a more
lofty carriage, nor affect a greater insolence.</p>
<p>When he goes through the City, he does so little regard any
body, that he is scarce induced to salute those Gentlemen that
civilly do prevent him by pulling off their hats first: but he
never begins to any body, no not to a Prince; which is so odious,
that for that only pleasure of seeing his pride abated, the
Romans do wish the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> death.</p>
<p>He did, what lay in his power, to make an eternal Enemy of the
Family of the <i>Colonna&rsquo;s</i>; which is the noblest and
best beloved of <i>Rome</i>, and countenanced by the greatest
Monarchs of Christendom; and if the <i>Pope</i> had not wisely
caused satisfaction to be made for the affront done to the
<i>Colonnas</i> at the Theatre, the Family of the <i>Chigi</i>
would have incurred the enmity of a House, which in time might
have been revenged, or at least in the quarrel the City of
<i>Rome</i> would have been divided, and in a kinde of War within
its self.</p>
<p>The Cardinal <i>Padrone</i> too on his side giving himself <a
name="page2_61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>too much up
to sensual pleasures, is the cause of great disorders in the
Court and Church; for all the Congregations of Cardinals, of
which he is the head, are much puzled how to deal with, and
humour a man, who cares for nothing less than that which is
committed to his care.&nbsp; Some of the Cardinals and Prelates
take example by him, and do commit great scandals; for which they
excuse themselves by saying, <i>That the Cardinal</i> Padrone
<i>does commit greater</i>.&nbsp; And thus betwixt them the poor
Church is ill serv&rsquo;d in both its Temporal and
Spiritual.</p>
<p>I have nothing to say of the other Nephews and Kindred of the
<i>Pope</i>; for supposed they had good inclinations, they have
little or no occasion to bring them to effect for the publick
good, they being not admitted to any publick employment.&nbsp;
And indeed it would be but loss of time for any body to summe up
the good this <i>Nipotismo</i> has done the Church; for it is so
little, and their ill actions are so many, that it would be
stifled by them, like good Corn by Tares.</p>
<p>The people is more oppressed than ever, the City is ill
provided, and all things are dear and scarce; the Prelates are
discontented, and the money it self is condemned to a perpetual
confinement in <i>Don Mario&rsquo;s</i>, and the
<i>Nipotismo&rsquo;s</i> Coffers.</p>
<p>It is a strange thing to see, that the <i>Popes</i> should
have the power to perswade others to renounce their fortunes, to
run into Monasteries, to embrace Pilgrimages, and Mortifications;
and yet not be able to perswade a little moderation to their
Nephews, and make them content themselves with that lawful
encrease of their Fortunes, which every <a
name="page2_62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>body is
well pleased to allow them: but they must still be laying taxes
upon the people, and discontent upon Princes and States.</p>
<p>I have a friend that is of opinion, that by the means of
Indulgences, the peoples vices do daily diminish.&nbsp; I know
not whether it be true or no, but I am sure that the
<i>Nipotismos</i> do daily increase, they little caring for
Indulgences, and being of opinion, that the <i>Pope</i> is
obliged to open them the door of Paradise by force.&nbsp; And
though this may be taken as a facetious conceit, yet I am certain
that the <i>Nipotismos</i> in good earnest do little frequent
Churches, but are more employed in getting of money, and taking
their pleasure.</p>
<p>But now it is time to speak of <i>Innocentius</i> the 10th.
his <i>Nipotismo</i>, of which it may be said, that it did a
little good, and no hurt; because it was alwayes under the
<i>Popes</i> disgrace, and <i>Donna Olympia&rsquo;s</i>
oppression; so that none of it were able to show either their
malice or their bounty, if they had any: for that good which they
did do, may be as well interpreted to proceed from a design of
winning the peoples favour, to whom only they could have recourse
in their disgrace, as from any good Principles of their own.</p>
<p>But however it were, the poor Church was never the better; for
what between <i>Innocentio&rsquo;s Capriccios</i>, and <i>Donna
Olympia&rsquo;s</i> tyranny, it was most miserably governed; and
the Court brought into such a disorder, that the like was never
seen before, nor I hope will not be hereafter: since the
impression and mark of those blows which it received then are
still to be seen in the face of the Church, and will appear to
fright all those that <a name="page2_63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>should go about to bring a like
scandal upon it.</p>
<p>And first the renunciation of the Cardinals Cap made by Prince
<i>Pamphilio</i>, though it were in it self a very necessary
action, for the preservation of the <i>Pamphilian</i> Family, was
nevertheless scandalous and injurious to the Churches reputation;
the more because being made without his Uncle&rsquo;s consent, it
so looked as if this eminent Dignity of Cardinal were a thing to
make sport with, and a profession as easily cast off without
shame, as it is ordinarily conferred without merit.</p>
<p>But this had been but an inconsiderable fault, which would
have been forgiven without pain in this disorderly age, if all
Christendom had not been offended by the tyrannical government of
the proud <i>Donna Olympia</i>; who having usurped that power
which the <i>Popes</i> do ordinarily confer on the
<i>Nipotismo</i>, had brought them to such a desperate case, that
they did almost revolt against their Uncle; whose humorsome fancy
did make such work by displacing one, and putting in another,
sometimes a true, sometimes a false Nephew, and sometimes
governing without any at all, that the most patient and
unconcern&rsquo;d spectator could not behold so capricious a
Prince without indignation.</p>
<p><i>The Nipotismo</i> being by <i>Donna Olympia&rsquo;s</i>
means depriv&rsquo;d of the power of doing good, had nevertheless
the faculty of doing mischief left them; and the Lady would have
been well pleased with it, for she did seek after all occasions
of making them odious to the <i>Pope</i>, and to every body else:
but they perceiving her design, became good, or at least
innocent, out of spight, that the imputation <a
name="page2_64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>of all the
miscarriages might fall upon her alone, they being not disposed
to bear a part of the pain, who had none in the pleasure.</p>
<p>For this reason the Prince <i>Pamphilio</i> was alwayes most
obliging and ready to serve the Church, and those that
requir&rsquo;d his assistance; giving therein demonstrations of
his good nature, and hopes that he might one day rule better with
his natural simplicity and equity, then <i>Donna Olympia</i> with
her refin&rsquo;d, but wicked policies.</p>
<p>So the two Princes <i>Ludovisio</i>, and <i>Giustiniani</i>
did behave themselves with all care and circumspection, out of a
design of pleasing the vulgar; since they could not be admitted
to please their Uncle, whose affections they had lost, without
having any thing laid to their charge that might deserve so
severe a punishment.&nbsp; Let us therefore conclude the
innocence of this <i>Nipotismo</i>, who never had the power of
doing any good, nor the convenience of doing any harm to the
Church; which nevertheless was severely handled by that impudent
and covetous <i>Donna Olympia</i>.</p>
<p>Now let us go a step higher, and come to the <i>Nipotismo</i>,
of <i>Urban</i>, or the reign of the <i>Barberins</i>; who seemed
to be born for the Empire of the world: and of them indeed there
is much to be said.&nbsp; For in the space of three and twenty
years, there was occasion for every one of them to show his parts
and inclinations, and make the world acquainted with their
temper.</p>
<p>They that have writ the life of <i>Urban</i>, having proposed
to themselves no other design than that of pleasing the
<i>Barberins</i>, do make perpetual Encomiums of his good
actions, but pass silently all <a name="page2_65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>his ill ones, that they might not
lose that favour, which to purchase they had undertaken to
transmit such gross flatteries to posterity.</p>
<p>There is no doubt but <i>Urban</i> did very much advantage the
Church and State, enriching them with a great number of
Hospitals, Churches, Colledges, Libraries, Castles, Forts,
Altars, Temples, Canonizations, and Beatifications: but if we
consider the greatness of his visible Revenue, for the space of
three and twenty year, we shall finde that his expences are
inconsiderable compared to it.</p>
<p>I am acquainted with a Roman, who had the curiosity for two
years together to inform himself of all the expences of the
<i>Barberins</i> in the Pontificate of their Uncle, that is, of
all the money they had laid out both for the Church and their own
Family, and found by computation, that the publick expense
consisted in nine millions and a half of Crowns; and their
visible private one in twelve.</p>
<p>Let it not seem strange to any one, if I say visible, for
every body knows, that the great policy of the <i>Nipotismo</i>
consists in hiding their own expenses, and publishing those that
they are at for the Church; whose rotten Walls they ordinarily
plaister over with a little Lime and Water, while they build new
ones for themselves, covering them with some sad colour that they
may hide the expense.</p>
<p>They that will please themselves, let them read the Life of
<i>Urban</i>, which has been inserted among the rest of the Lives
of the <i>Popes</i>, composed by <i>Platina</i>, and there they
will meet with such a quantity of his good works, that they
cannot chuse but esteem him as one of the holiest <i>Popes</i>
that ever <a name="page2_66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>was; but they that are otherwise inform&rsquo;d, are
mov&rsquo;d to laugh both at the <i>Pope</i> and the Author.</p>
<p>There you shall meet with nothing but, that the <i>Pope</i>
visited such a Church, confirmed such a Decree of his
Predecessor, gave the people his Benediction from the Church of
St. <i>Jean</i> of <i>Lateran</i>, visited the Hospital of the
Trinity, made a great exhortation to the Bishops, excited the
Monks to reform, beautified St. <i>Andr&egrave; Avellino</i>,
received Ambassadors with great state, opened the Holy Year with
Magnificence, consecrated the Church of the <i>Vatican</i>, gave
the title of Cardinalate to the Church of St. <i>Charles</i>,
re-built the Colledge of the Grecians, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p>But all this while not a word of the Progress of <i>Gustave
Adolfe</i> in <i>Germany</i>, of the Turk in the other parts of
Christendom (while the <i>Pope</i> lets them both alone) of the
excommunication of the Duke of <i>Parma</i>, of that of the State
of <i>Lucca</i>, of the affront done to the State of
<i>Venice</i>, of the disrespect show&rsquo;d to the Crown of
<i>France</i> in divers occasions, of the War begun in
<i>Italy</i>, of the Catholick Religion declining in
<i>Poland</i>, of the Artifices used in the War of the
<i>Valtolina</i>, and in a word, of so many miscarriages, and
offences given to <i>Rome</i>, the State, and all Christendom, by
the extravagant passions of the <i>Barberins</i>: Of all this I
say there is not a syllable, nor the least mention.</p>
<p>Every one knows that <i>Germany</i>, the Empire, and the
Catholick Religion were upon the brim of their ruine, for want of
succour; and yet at that very time the <i>Barberins</i>, did make
War upon the Princes of <i>Italy</i>, with the treasure of the
Church; <a name="page2_67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>their minde being more bent upon the raising of their
Family, than upon the conservation of Christendom.</p>
<p>And the mischief was, that they did so besiege the
<i>Pope</i>, that there was no means of informing him of the
deplorable state of the Affairs of Christendom; for neither the
Emperour, nor the King of <i>Poland</i> could ever obtain any
answer to their demands, which I believe never came to the
knowledge of the <i>Pope</i>, no more than their dangers.&nbsp;
The <i>Nipotismo</i> answering their Ambassadors conformably to
their own interest, without any regard to the Fatherly and
Pastoral care, to which their Uncle was bound by the duty of his
place.</p>
<p>But that which was worst of all, was, that they did not openly
refuse their help, but by delayes and promises keeping still the
Emperour and King of <i>Poland</i> in hopes, they made them
neglect to make peace with their Enemies, and refuse those
conditions, which else they would have accepted, had not the
<i>Barberins</i> entertain&rsquo;d them with the hopes now of an
Army, then of a great summe of Money; and at last disappointed
them of all.</p>
<p>However the people of the State belonging to the Church were
the worse for it; for the <i>Barberins</i> taking occasion from
the obligation the <i>Pope</i> was in, to assist these Princes,
did thereupon lay most heavy Taxes and Impositions upon both
Church-men and Layes: The simple people stirred up by the
exhortations of some Preachers who made it their business to
declare in their Sermons, That God could not be better pleased
then by that assistance given to the distressed Catholicks, did
sell all their Jewels and preciousest Houshold-stuff <a
name="page2_68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>to give
away to those that had the Commission of gathering their
Benevolence.</p>
<p>Out of these summes which were thus raised, the
<i>Barberins</i> did send it may be one or two in the hundred,
and this after so long waiting, and by such chargeable wayes,
that half of the money was absorbed in the exchange: which the
Emperour and King of <i>Poland</i> having perceived, they were
fain to give over their soliciting the <i>Barberins</i>, and
defend themselves as well as they could.</p>
<p>The Protestants themselves, though much rejoycing at the
decaying state of the Catholick Religion in <i>Germany</i>, were
nevertheless infinitely scandalized at the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i>
proceedings, saying, as it was true, <i>That the</i> Barberins
<i>did the Catholicks more mischief by denying them succour with
such dilatory wayes</i>, <i>than the Protestants by the force of
Arms</i>.</p>
<p>In a word, I think it is not a hard thing to perswade that the
<i>Barberins</i> in the time of their reign did the Church a
great deal of mischief; it would be much a harder to convince any
body of the good they have done: and it is so difficult a
business, that for my part I shall not undertake it; only I will
give the <i>Barberins</i> this good counsel, which is, that if
they desire to make posterity lose the memory of their ill
conduct under their Uncle, they endeavour to get Cardinal
<i>Francesco Barberino</i> made <i>Pope</i> after the death of
<i>Alexander</i>; for so it may be, that as in their
Uncle&rsquo;s time they did much more hurt then good, they will
under Cardinal <i>Francesco</i>, who is pious and vertuous do
more good than hurt.</p>
<p>There is an example of this already in the two <i>Popes</i> of
the Family of <i>la Rovere</i>; <i>Sixtus</i> the <a
name="page2_69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>4th. and
<i>Julius</i> the second; for in the time of <i>Sixtus</i> the
<i>Nipotismo</i> was most highly guilty towards the Church, and
did much harm, and little good; but under <i>Julius</i> it did
much good, and little harm: so the same thing may happen for the
<i>Barberins</i>, if <i>Francesco</i> be made <i>Pope</i>.</p>
<p><i>Gregory</i> the 15th. who was <i>Urban&rsquo;s</i>
Predecessor, lived to do mischief enough, but it seems had no
time to do good: of the four parts of the Popedom his Nephew had
three, and he one.</p>
<p>All this Popes thoughts were bent upon the Protestants ruine,
particularly, he had a spight to <i>Geneva</i>, calling it the
nest of the Devil; and therefore he pressed the Duke of
<i>Savoy</i> to besiege it, promising him great succors of men
and money.&nbsp; He likewise assisted with all might and main the
Emperour in his War against the Protestants of
<i>Germany</i>.&nbsp; He failed not to solicit the King of
<i>France</i> to torment and molest the <i>Huguenots</i> of his
Kingdom, and prevailed with him to do it: which cost him dear,
and had like to have proved fatal to his Monarchy, though at last
he remained victorious.</p>
<p>The Cardinal <i>Ludovisio</i> his Nephew, quite contrary, did
what lay in his power, to quell in his Uncle, this unmeasurable
desire of ruining the Protestants, and engaging all Christendom
into bloody Wars; but the <i>Pope</i> would never hearken to any
thing that he could say about that particular, answering him
alwayes in these words, <i>&rsquo;Tis enough that I let you do
what you will with the Catholicks</i>; <i>pray let me have the
liberty of doing what I please against the Hereticks our
enemies</i>.</p>
<p>His Remonstrances to Ambassadors upon this Subject, were so
frequent at every audience that <a name="page2_70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>they were tired with them; and when
sometimes the Cardinal <i>Ludovisio</i> would interpose, and say
something to qualifie the heat of the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i>
exaggerations, he would command him to hold his tongue; and
sometimes say to him, you have a touch of an Heritick in you.</p>
<p>He did all his endeavours by a thousand plots and Artifices,
to reduce <i>England</i> again under the obedience of the Church
of <i>Rome</i>, but all to no purpose: at last, seeing himself
disappointed in this his main design after such pains and
expense, he resolved to get back to <i>Rome</i>.&nbsp; <i>Marc
Antony de Dominis</i>, who in the time of <i>Paul</i> the fifth
<i>Gregories</i> Predecessor, had left <i>Italy</i>, and was fled
into England; where, having declared himself Protestant, he did
write many shrewd books against the <i>Pope</i>, and the Court of
<i>Rome</i>, as one who was well informed of all its
disorders.</p>
<p>The <i>Pope</i>, the better to compass his intention, sent to
<i>London</i> certain Prelates disguised, who had been heretofore
intimate with <i>Marc Antony</i>.&nbsp; These, coming to him
secretly, promised him not only the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> and the
Churches pardon; but also assured him, that he should be made
Cardinal at the next promotion.&nbsp; The Archbishop, trusting to
the Oaths and Engagement of these Prelates, left <i>England</i>,
and return&rsquo;d once more to <i>Rome</i>, where he made a
recantation of all his Errours, as they call&rsquo;d them; But a
little after, being carefully watched by the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i>
Spies, they took hold of some words that he said; and having
clapt him up in the Inquisition Prison, began to question him for
Heresie; and without doubt he had undergone the dreadful fire of
the <i>Roman</i> Purgatory, if timely death had not prevented the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> revenge.</p>
<p><a name="page2_71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>In a
word, this <i>Pope</i> had undertaken the ruine of all Protestant
Princes; wherefore he sent great Succours to the Emperour in his
war against the Prince <i>Palatine</i> of <i>Rhine</i>, who after
some resistance was driven out of his Country, and proclaimed
Traytor to the Empire: whereupon his dignity of Prince Elector
was conferred upon <i>Maximilian</i>, Duke of <i>Baviere</i>, a
Catholick Prince, much protected by the <i>Pope</i>.</p>
<p>And the Emperour, in acknowledgment of the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i>
zeal and affection, presented him with the Prince
<i>Palatines</i> Library, esteemed, for the great number of
Manuscripts in all Tongues, one of the most famous of all
<i>Europe</i>: The <i>Pope</i>, having thanked his Imperial
Majesty, caused the Library to be transported to <i>Rome</i> with
great charge and expence; and as soon as it came, he solemnly
sanctified it with his blessing, and so laid it up.</p>
<p><i>Paul</i> the fifth was almost of the same humour, though he
did not undertake things so rashly, but would wisely consider the
good and evil that might come of them.&nbsp; It is believed, that
in his time an infinite number of Hereticks return&rsquo;d to the
Church of <i>Rome</i>; but I am sure, that above a hundred
<i>Italian</i> Families forsook their Country, and withdrew into
Protestant Princes Territories, where they might freely follow
the Rites of their Religion.&nbsp; Particularly, they went to
<i>Geneva</i>, where great numbers resorted every day, and above
all many <i>Lucheses</i>, of which some are now aggregated
amongst the principal Families of that City.</p>
<p>This <i>Pope</i>, though so zealous for the Church, was
nevertheless very Indulgent to his Family, who did usurp a power
and authority, as prejudicial to the Church as it was offensive
to Princes; with whom the <a name="page2_72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span><i>Borgheses</i>, as well as the
<i>Barberins</i>, would often enter into contest.</p>
<p>In the time of this <i>Pope</i>, <i>Italy</i> had like to have
seen sixteen Cities of it become Protestants, as Monsieur <i>De
Lion</i>, the French King&rsquo;s Embassadour told the
<i>Pope</i>; and thus the occasion was:</p>
<p>Paul <i>and his Kindred</i>, <i>for I know not what
reasons</i>, <i>did bear a secret grudge to the State of</i>
Venice, <i>and did wait for nothing more than for some occasion
of shewing their spleen</i>; <i>and it falling out that the State
of</i> Venice, <i>according to their ancient Form of
Government</i>, <i>did put some Church-men in Prison</i>;
<i>the</i> Pope <i>upon the notice of it excommunicated not only
the Senate</i>, <i>but the whole Nation of the</i> Venetians,
<i>as if they had been guilty of their Magistrates
fault</i>.&nbsp; <i>But these wise Senators were not so easily
daunted</i>, <i>but resolving either to preserve their power and
authority within their Government</i>, <i>or to hazard the ruine
of it</i>, <i>set some of their Divines on work to write against
the</i> Pope&rsquo;s <i>authority</i>, <i>and his
Excommunication</i>; <i>which writings did then</i>, <i>and have
since produced so great an effect in the minds of most men</i>,
<i>that now there is not any little Prince of</i> Italy <i>that
cares for the</i> Popes <i>Excommunication</i>, <i>as it has been
clearly seen by the examples of the Duke of</i> Parma, <i>the
Commonwealth of</i> Lucca, <i>the Duke</i> Charles <i>of</i>
Lorain, <i>and many others</i>.</p>
<p>The constancy of the <i>Venetians</i> was invincible in this
occasion, and so great, that they sent the <i>Pope</i> word,
<i>That if he did not recall his Excommunication they would
provide for their own preservation by such remedies as should
become the dignity of their State</i>, <i>and its ancient
Majesty</i>.</p>
<p>And that they might the sooner bring the <i>Pope</i> to their
desires, they politickly sent to <i>Geneva</i> to require <a
name="page2_73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>that City
to send them some of their most able Ministers to instruct them
in the Protestant Religion.&nbsp; This Artifice having frighted
the <i>Pope</i> into a condescendency, he was fain to come to an
agreement very disadvantageous for the honour of the Sea of
<i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>If this <i>Pope</i> had not been so unjustly severe towards
the State of <i>Venice</i>, he would have left a much better name
behind him.&nbsp; For to say truth, he did the Church much more
good than evil: but it was, and will be, a great spot to his
reputation to have gone about to undo the Bulwark of Christendom:
for such has the State of <i>Venice</i> alwaies been reputed.</p>
<p>We must be forced to skip <i>Leo</i> the eleventh (for his
short life gave him no time to do good, and hindred him from
doing any harm to the Church) and come to <i>Clement</i> the
eighth, who was a <i>Pope</i> that lived both with his Kindred,
and for them a good while.</p>
<p>Christendom was involved in great troubles when he came to the
Pontificate, there being nothing but Wars and Divisions.&nbsp;
The Turks did assault <i>Germany</i>, and the Protestants did
torment the rest of the Catholick Princes; besides that, the
banish&rsquo;d Criminals of the Kingdom of <i>Naples</i> had made
themselves Masters of a great part of it, and spread themselves
over all the Country.&nbsp; The <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> main end,
amongst all these disorders, was first to provide for his
Kindred; and that care took up so much of his time and treasure,
that he was not in a condition to succour those Princes that were
fighting for the defence of that Religion of which he was the
Head.&nbsp; In the mean time the <i>Spaniards</i>, who had a mind
<a name="page2_74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>to
hinder Henry King of Navar from possessing the Crown of France,
which he was lawful Heir of; foreseeing that of themselves they
would not be able to resist <i>Henry&rsquo;s</i> Right, nor hold
out against so generous and warlike a Prince, they did their
utmost Endeavours to get the Pope on their side, and declare
against the King of Navar, as against an Heretick, and by
consequent incapable of receiving the Crown.</p>
<p>At first, the <i>Pope</i> refused to engage openly in a
business which would be necessarily expensive and troublesom; and
therefore for a while he let the <i>Spaniards</i> alone, hoping
that of themselves they would be strong enough to effect the Work
without him: But they having perceived his intention, soon made a
breach in it by the means of the <i>Nipotismo</i>, which they
gained; and at whose perswasion the <i>Pope</i> sent an Army
under the Conduct of <i>Appio Conti</i>, who was kill&rsquo;d in
an Encounter by some of <i>Henry&rsquo;s</i> Forces.</p>
<p>The Catholick Princes of the Realm of France, who were on
Henry&rsquo;s side, together with the greatest part of the
Nation, sent upon this the Marquis of <i>Pisani</i> to
<i>Rome</i>, to desire the Pope to recall his Army, and not to
oppose a Prince who had promised to be instructed in the
Catholick Religion: But the <i>Pope</i> not only refused their
Request, but would not so much as endure that the Marquis should
set his foot in any part of the State of the Church.</p>
<p>Things being in this posture, <i>Henry</i> at last resolved to
dash all his Adversaries Machines to pieces at one blow; and
therefore he solemnly renounced his Heresie, and was reconciled
to the Church: So in spite of the <i>Pope</i> and the
<i>Spaniards</i>, he obtained a Crown, which could never have
encompassed a more worthy Head than his.&nbsp; After this, the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Army <a name="page2_75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>was fain to retire, having done
little or nothing.</p>
<p>The same hapned in <i>Flanders</i>, whither he sent another
Army to help the <i>Spaniards</i> against the <i>United
Provinces</i>, who, since the death of the Duke of <i>Parma</i>,
had obtained many Victories; but it was with as little success as
the first: So that the <i>Pope</i>, weary of spending the
Treasure of the Church to no purpose, commanded his Forces home,
leaving the <i>Spaniards</i> to look after their own Affairs.</p>
<p>The Expences of this <i>Pope</i> were exorbitant; for he did
undertake every thing rashly, and more out of <i>Capriccio</i>,
than ripe judgment and deliberation: So that he undoubtedly did
the Church more hurt than good.</p>
<p>There is little to be said of <i>Innocent</i> the Ninth,
<i>Gregory</i> the Fourteenth, and <i>Urban</i> the Seventh; for
the greatest mischief they did the Church, was, that they
liv&rsquo;d so little.&nbsp; We will therefore come to
<i>Sixtus</i> the Fifth.</p>
<p>The <i>Nipotismo</i> of this <i>Pope</i> was one of the most
innocent ones that ever was seen; for he hindred them from taking
any part in the Government: So that they were in the Court, like
Beggars at a Church door, of whom few People take notice.</p>
<p>Not that he was so severe, as to hinder them from a share in
his Fortune; for he did bestow large Revenues upon them all:
observing nevertheless, to refuse always every thing that they
begg&rsquo;d, and to give them when they least thought of
it.&nbsp; He did much affect this sort of Generosity, or rather
Soverainty; for he never suffered any of his Relations to put
their hands into his Coffers; nay, he was so absolute, that once
he banished a Kinsman of his, because he found his House better
furnished, than it could be by those <a name="page2_76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Gratifications which he had received
from the <i>Pope</i>, who used no more words with him but these,
<i>We have given you so much</i>, <i>and you have so much</i>;
<i>How came you by the rest</i>?&nbsp; And so without delay he
banish&rsquo;d him, and divided his Fortune amongst his other
Relations.</p>
<p>If the Nephews of other <i>Popes</i> become rich, it is by the
abuse they make of that Authority which they usurp in the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Name.&nbsp; But it was not so with the
<i>Nipotismo</i> of <i>Sixtus</i>; for he never gave blindly, but
with his eyes open, and discreetly: And if there were any Error
committed in their growing rich, it was the <i>Pope</i> that was
the Author of it, and not they, who were meerly passive, and did
but receive their Uncles Liberalities.</p>
<p>There is no doubt, but that under this <i>Pope</i> the Church
received much more benefit than damage; for the <i>Nipotismo</i>
having no Power, could not be otherwise than good and innocent;
and the <i>Pope</i> himself was so wise and vertuous a Prince,
that there were few Miscarriages in his time; if we except that
only occasion, in which <i>Sixtus</i>, by his too hasty
Excommunication of King <i>Henry</i> the Third of <i>France</i>,
brought the Church in danger of losing for ever so noble and
flourishing a part of <i>Christendom</i>; as it had hapned
already, by the rashness of one <i>Pope</i>, that the Kingdom of
<i>England</i> was entirely lost, only because <i>Clement</i> the
Seventh would not yield a little of his Authority.&nbsp; And
indeed, I think, the greatest blemish upon the Reputation of
<i>Sixtus</i> is, that he suffer&rsquo;d himself to be so far
transported with anger, as to Excommunicate <i>Henry</i> the
Third of <i>France</i>, for having caused the Cardinal of
<i>Guise</i> to be killed, and the Cardinal of <i>Bourbon</i> to
be shut up in a close Prison, <a name="page2_77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>with the Archbishop of <i>Lyons</i>,
who were indeed all three Traytors to the Kingdom, and
Conspirators against the Royal Person of <i>Henry</i>.&nbsp; The
Consistory of Cardinals did oppose this violent Resolution of
<i>Sixtus</i>, by remonstrating to him the terrible consequence
of it, and the danger that all the Church would incur by the loss
of so noble a Christian Kingdom.</p>
<p>But the <i>Pope</i> laughing at all this, answered the
Cardinals in this manner; <i>If therefore you will have it
so</i>, <i>we will bring it to pass</i>, <i>that from
henceforward you shall be neither honour&rsquo;d nor
reverenc&rsquo;d by Princes nor Kings</i>; <i>but
despis&rsquo;d</i>, <i>vilified</i>, <i>and exposed to the hands
both of the Oppressor</i>, <i>and the Executioner</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Certainly</i>, <i>if the killing of Cardinals be
conniv&rsquo;d at</i>, <i>and pass&rsquo;d over without
resentment and chastisement</i>, <i>it may very easily become the
Case of every one of you</i>.&nbsp; <i>However</i>, <i>we will
rather do that which Justice requires</i>, <i>though you little
care that Reason be done for the Violence committed</i>, <i>not
so much against you</i>, <i>as the Sacred Purple</i>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the <i>Pope</i> was wary, not to precipitate
things so suddenly; but suffered five Months to pass, after the
death of the Cardinal of <i>Guise</i>: during which interval, he
made by Letters several Admonitions to the King; all which proved
to no purpose, the King being resolute not to free the Cardinal
out of Prison, which the <i>Pope</i> so vehemently urged.&nbsp;
Whereupon, seeing he could not prevail, he thundered out the
greater Excommunication, with all the accustomed Forms, against
the King, and against all those who in the said matter should
afford Counsel to, or in any manner whatsoever assist him.&nbsp;
Besides which, he also cited the said King <a
name="page2_78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>to make his
personal Appearance at <i>Rome</i>, within the term of seventy
days, there to give account of the Death of the Cardinal of
<i>Guise</i>, and the Imprisonment of the Cardinal of
<i>Bourbon</i>.</p>
<p>The King conceived great indignation upon this proceeding of
the <i>Pope</i>, and began to advise with the Prelates, Bishops,
and Counsellors of greatest trust with him, how to ward off such
a Storm; and things were carried so far, that the Council-Royal
seem&rsquo;d resolv&rsquo;d to create a Patriarch in
<i>France</i>, particularly for the <i>Gallicane</i> Church, who
should not in any wise be subject to, or have so much as the
least Communication with the Church of <i>Rome</i>: And
&rsquo;tis likely the <i>French</i>, who affect Novelties, would
not have been backward to close with this Resolution.</p>
<p>But whilst Matters went on in this manner, it so came to pass,
that the King, as he lay with a great Army at S. <i>Cloud</i>,
two Leagues from <i>Paris</i>, was on the first day of
<i>August</i>, in the year 1569. wounded in the belly with a
two-edged Knife, by a Dominican Fryar named <i>Jaques Clement</i>
Native of the City of <i>Lans</i>, and of the age of twenty three
years, as he was receiving Letters from the hand of the said
Friar, who was upon his knees; of which Wound he died within
fourteen hours, in regard his Entrals were pierc&rsquo;d, having
imploy&rsquo;d this short in ordering such things as concerned
his Soul.</p>
<p>This Murder hapned seventy eight days after the Summons by the
<i>Pope</i> for his Appearance at <i>Rome</i>, within seventy
days; and his Holiness rejoyced not a little at it, since hereby
the displeasure, which the Consistory of Cardinals, the People,
and Nobility had conceiv&rsquo;d against him, as one that
car&rsquo;d not much <a name="page2_79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>to see the destruction of a Kingdom,
which would breed disturbance to the common quiet of
<i>Italy</i>, from Age to Age, both by Sea and Land.</p>
<p>Great were the Stirs which succeeded in <i>France</i> after
the King&rsquo;s death; inasmuch as <i>Henry</i> King of
<i>Navar</i>, next Heir to the Crown, began to endeavour the
possession thereof, by warring against the Lords of the
<i>Ligue</i>, who were back&rsquo;d and upheld by the
<i>Spaniards</i>, by whom the Succession of <i>Henry</i> was
infinitely opposed.</p>
<p>In these Commotions and Broils of <i>France</i>, the
<i>Pope</i> gave not those Assistances to the <i>Ligue</i>, which
they expected and required; and this upon several accounts, but
especially because he would not condescend to the Instances of
the Cardinals and the <i>Spaniards</i>, who much solicited him;
giving them this answer, <i>When we were against the dead</i>
Henry, <i>all you were our Opponents</i>; <i>Now that you would
persecute the living</i> Henry, <i>we will not side with you</i>,
<i>for the sake of our own Interest</i>.</p>
<p>It was not a little displeasing to the King of <i>Spain</i>,
that the <i>Pope</i> did not succour the <i>Ligue</i>, nor
declare Excommunicate those Princes and Prelates that followed
the side of <i>Navar</i>; so that the King resolv&rsquo;d to make
some Protestations to the <i>Pope</i> concerning this
Tergiversation.&nbsp; But his Holiness wanted not Pretexts to
fence with, and in a manner made sport with those <i>Spanish</i>
Cardinals, who importun&rsquo;d him either to unite with the
<i>Ligue</i>, or send considerable Assistance to it.</p>
<p><i>Gregory</i> the Thirteenth had Nephews, who did not
degenerate from the Name of <i>Buoncompagno</i>; that is to say,
they little car&rsquo;d to do good, and less to do evil.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, according to the Instinct <a
name="page2_80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>which seems
natural to <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Nephews, this Family of
<i>Buoncompagno</i> could not restrain it self from disgusting
some of the principal Persons of the City, by the death of two
Gentlemen, pretended to be slain by accident, through the
indiscretion of the <i>Sbirri</i> or Serjeants.&nbsp; A Policy
observed by all Nephews, to colour their vindicative Outrages
upon all occasions.</p>
<p>From hence it may be gathered, That the intention of the
<i>Buoncompagni</i> propended more to Evil than to Good; and
accordingly they fail&rsquo;d not to give Instances of the
former, though &rsquo;tis hard to find any of the latter.</p>
<p>But if Nephewship ever did good in <i>Rome</i>, &rsquo;twas in
the time of <i>Pius</i> the Fifth, when all the Proceedings of
the Nephews were directed to Good, in regard they wanted Spirit
to gainsay the good intention of this <i>Pope</i>; who could not
endure to see them in <i>Rome</i>, out of a jealousie, that being
fatned with the Treasure of the Church, they might fall into the
same wicked Road, which had been trodden out by so many
others.</p>
<p><i>Paul</i> the Fourth (for there is not much to be said of
<i>Pius</i> the Fourth) took not the same course; for he
advanc&rsquo;d a Nephew, who for the space of neer five years,
knew not how to do any thing but evil, and evil so enormous, that
his Uncle was forced to drive him out of <i>Rome</i>, and his
Successor to put him to death in <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>In the beginning of this <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Reign, the
Murthers, Rapes, Violences, Robberies, Cheats, Injustices, and a
thousand other Enormities and Vices, which surrounded the
Ecclesiastical State, to the damage of all <i>Christendom</i>,
were attributed to the <i>Pope</i>, who had set up his Kindred in
<i>Rome</i>; whom <a name="page2_81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>after the <i>Pope</i> had banished the City, his
Holiness&rsquo;s Reputation seem&rsquo;d to revive in the hearts
of the Catholicks, who had been scandalized at him, and now saw,
that all the Mischiefs were to be attributed to the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> wicked Relations.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis a strange thing, That amongst so many Nephews great
and small of the House of <i>Caraffa</i>, into whose hand the
<i>Pope</i> had put the Government of the Church, there should
not be one into whose head ever came so much as a single thought
to do any manner of good to the Church, to <i>Christendom</i>, or
to the afflicted State Ecclesiastical.</p>
<p>The mischief which the Nephews of <i>Pope Caraffa</i> brought
to the Church, or rather to the whole World, was so great, that
to this present day the People of <i>Rome</i> retain a certain
impression of hatred against all that bear the Name of
<i>Caraffa</i>, however Noble Gentlemen; it not being possible
for any so much as to behold one of them, without regret and
aversion.</p>
<p>Cardinal <i>Caraffa</i> was twice in danger (I say, in danger;
for in him the <i>Papacy</i> would have been endanger&rsquo;d) to
be <i>Pope</i>; Once at the time of the Election of
<i>Innocent</i>, and before at that of <i>Urban</i>; But at both
times he was excluded, for the sole consideration of his being of
the Family of <i>Caraffa</i>; the very Name whereof, in
remembrance of the Nephews of <i>Paul</i> the Fourth, remains
extremely odious both to small and great.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Cardinal in himself was a Person of merit, and
vertue sufficient, to enable to ascend to such a Dignity, as well
as those others that have ascended in his place.&nbsp; Some
excluded him, because they doubted lest the <i>Caraffi</i> would
turn once again to the <i>Sicut erat</i>, that is, to aggrandize
themselves <a name="page2_82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>at the cost of the Church, and the damage of all
<i>Christendom</i>; and so much the more, in regard the number of
the said Cardinal&rsquo;s Nephews was so great, that even himself
could hardly count them; notwithstanding that he did what he
could to make it believed, that he was wholly free from personal
interest, as well as that of blood.</p>
<p>Long would the discourse be, and infinite the words, if I were
obliged to give account of the Nephews of all the <i>Popes</i>,
one after another (according to the order begun) down to
<i>Sixtus</i> the fourth: to whom, as being the Introducer, not
of the <i>Nipotismo</i> it self into <i>Rome</i>, but of the
Pride and boundless Authority thereof, may be justly attributed
all the Evil, which, for the two last Ages, the Nephews of
<i>Popes</i> have caused to the Church.</p>
<p>Wherefore, I will for the present omit to make a distinct
survey of the mischiefs of the other; partly, because I know not
readily how to discover the good of any; and partly, because my
heart will not suffer me to view, without tears, the Evil of all;
which is the more grievous, because irremediable.</p>
<p>What might I say of <i>Marcellus</i> the second, who lived but
a short time, and gave no authority to his Nephews?&nbsp; Or what
of <i>Julius</i> the third, who minded nothing else but Feasting,
sometimes with one, sometimes with another; and kept his Kindred
at <i>Rome</i>, rather to accompany him to Entertainments, than
to assist him in the Government of the Church, which he little
heeded?</p>
<p>What Discourse shall I make of <i>Paul</i> the Third, who
would have had the <i>Farnesian</i> Lillies turned the State of
the Church into one sole Garden for their own use?&nbsp; Or of
<i>Clement</i> the Seventh, who out of a <i>Capriccio</i> <a
name="page2_83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>lost the
Kingdom, by refusing to grant <i>Henry</i> the Eighth of
<i>England</i> a Divorce from <i>Catherine</i>, and a Licence to
marry <i>Anne Bouillon</i>, with whom he was in love?&nbsp; What
praise shall I attribute to <i>Adrian</i> the Sixth, a great
Enemy to his own Relations, and perpetually averse from the
introducing of a <i>Nipotismo</i>?</p>
<p>What shall I say of <i>Leo</i> the Tenth, of the most Noble
Family of the <i>Medici</i>?&nbsp; Where shall I find the good
which he did to the Church, spoiling other Princes of their
States, to transfer them to his own House?&nbsp; What Title shall
we give to <i>Julius</i> the Second, of whom it was not known
whether he were inclin&rsquo;d to the hatred or love of his
Relations?&nbsp; What shall I say of <i>Pius</i> the Third, who
liv&rsquo;d not long enough to receive the Visits of his
Kindred?</p>
<p>But if there be not much to be said of the forementioned
<i>Popes</i>, there is a super-abundance of matter to be said of
<i>Alexander</i> the Sixth, whose very memory raises horror in
the breasts of the <i>Romans</i>, even to this day.&nbsp; It
seems God Almighty thought fit to chastise <i>Christendom</i>
with the barbarity of this <i>Pope</i>, who, not contented with
his own cruel, covetous, and insatiable nature, introduc&rsquo;d
a <i>Nipotismo</i> not degenerating from the manners of their
Uncle.</p>
<p>Amongst the other <i>Popes</i> and their Nephews, was seen,
though in the midst of much ill, some spark and glimmering of
good; whereas in the Person of <i>Alexander</i> and his Nephews,
was never perceptible the least ray of good, amidst a vast Ocean
of evil; deplorable even by future Ages, not only to those which
were so unhappy as to see him living.</p>
<p>Some strongly believed, That this <i>Barbarian Pope</i> had
sworn himself, and caus&rsquo;d his Kindred likewise to <a
name="page2_84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>swear,
<i>Never to do good to the Church</i>.&nbsp; And they had reason
to think so, whilst no sort of Reason prevailed with him, or any
of them, who acted all things with an Authority not otherwise
limited than by their own unbridled Passion.</p>
<p>He would not allow that the City of <i>Rome</i> should enjoy
certain holy priviledges peculiar to it alone; and therefore in
the year 1500, having publish&rsquo;d an Universal <i>Jubile</i>,
he granted more Indulgences to those that staid at home than to
those who, as the custom is, came to visit the Churches of
<i>Rome</i>, ordain&rsquo;d for that purpose.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some were willing to think that he did this out
of good policy, as doubting lest, all the people of Christendom
being already offended with the wicked carriage of his Sons,
there might happen at <i>Rome</i>, amidst the variety and
confusion of sundry Nations, some resolution to the prejudice of
all his House.&nbsp; But such reasons had no place in his mind;
for those that came to <i>Rome</i>, were led thither by devotion;
and the diversity of Nations hinders the Union of a People that
would take Arms against their Lord.</p>
<p>The principal cause lay in his own humour, which was cruel and
totally averse from doing good to any others besides his own
Relations: And whereas by so great a concourse the <i>Romans</i>
were likely to gain something by the traffick of holy
Merchandise, to wit, Medals, Crowns, and other consecrated works,
besides the Rent of Lodgings, and sale of Provisions; He would
not that they should enjoy this benefit, although the hindrance
of it was accompanied with loss both to himself, the Church of
St. <i>Peter</i>, and the Office of the Datary.</p>
<p><a name="page2_85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>All
the good he did to the Church, was, that he shew&rsquo;d himself
very liberal to Writers and Learned men of all sorts; not out of
any natural inclination towards them, but only to oblige them to
write well of himself and his Kindred.&nbsp; And accordingly
there were some infamous Writers (as I may deservedly call them)
who made comparison between his Raign and that of
<i>Alexander</i>, with a parallel of the qualities of these two
persons.&nbsp; Amongst the rest one made a Book, intituled,
<i>The glories of the Papacy of</i> Alexander <i>the Sixth and
the</i> Borgian <i>Family</i>.&nbsp; God give a thousand ill
years to such Writers, who flatter falsly, and at their pleasure
make Angels of Devils, and Saints of Tyrants.</p>
<p>An other good thing which this <i>Pope</i> seem&rsquo;d to do
to the City of <i>Rome</i>, was, that there being a great dearth
in the State, he caused great plenty of corn to be brought from
<i>Sicily</i>, and by this means render&rsquo;d the City very
plentifully stored.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twas not any affection for
the people that induc&rsquo;d him to it, but he did it out of
consideration of great profit to himself; for he sold corn at
<i>Rome</i> for double the price it cost in <i>Sicily</i>,
trading with the Churches money, and putting the gain into the
purse of his Bastards.&nbsp; Whence it may be concluded, that he
never had any intention to do good to the publick.</p>
<p><i>Innocent</i> the eighth, of the house of <i>Cibo</i>, was
as benign and inclin&rsquo;d to do good, as <i>Alexander</i> was
cruel and addicted to do evil.&nbsp; The truth is,
<i>Innocent</i>, who gave neither Offices nor Riches to his
Relations, but with moderation (as I have said in due place) was
a <i>Pope</i> worthy of that time, when Christendom seem&rsquo;d
to be threatned with most heavy calamities.</p>
<p><a name="page2_86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>This
man studied from morning to night how to procure benefit to the
Church, ease to the People, and comfort to the Catholicks; so
that no sooner was any thing mention&rsquo;d to him, but he
presently answer&rsquo;d, <i>So be that it bring good to the
Publick</i>.&nbsp; From whence it may easily be gather&rsquo;d,
that all his motions tended to do good, and were far from the
design of doing evil.</p>
<p>He rewarded all those Cardinals who had nominated and promoted
him to the Papal Chair.&nbsp; To the Monastick Orders he granted
particular favours and priviledges, especially to that of St.
<i>Dominique</i> and St. <i>Francis</i>.&nbsp; He lightned the
Church, and likewise the Palace and Court of all superfluous
expenses.&nbsp; He us&rsquo;d great charity towards the
Poor.&nbsp; He lov&rsquo;d his Country, and caus&rsquo;d most
ample satisfaction to be given to the <i>Genoeses</i> who had
been ill treated during the vacancy of the See.&nbsp; He
honour&rsquo;d, and requir&rsquo;d others to honour all
extraneous Nations of the World; insomuch that the Turk himself
sent an Embassadour to him with some Presents, meerly because he
had understood this generous demeanour of the <i>Pope</i>;
amongst which Presents was the Title of the Holy Cross, and the
Spear which pierc&rsquo;d the side of our Saviour.&nbsp; Thus the
<i>Romans</i> report and believe; and accordingly I write it.</p>
<p>He readily pardon&rsquo;d injuries receiv&rsquo;d, provided
his Pardon were desir&rsquo;d with humility; and he
receiv&rsquo;d Embassadours with so great curtesies, that in
those days, the Princes of Christendom knew not how to do a
greater favour to a deserving Officer of State than to send him
Embassadour to <i>Rome</i>, to negotiate with so worthy and good
a <i>Pope</i>.</p>
<p>He re-bless&rsquo;d the <i>Venetians</i>, who had been
interdicted <a name="page2_87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>by his Predecessor; and although a <i>Genoese</i>, yet
he omitted not to bestow divers favours on the Senate; being wont
to say, <i>That Popes may receive great honour by keeping good
correspondence with the Republick</i>, <i>and great shame by
breaking with it</i>.&nbsp; Whence during his Government he
entred into League with the <i>Venetians</i>, not in order to
raise war against any, but only for procuring an Universal peace,
and the tranquillity of all Christendom.</p>
<p>He suppress&rsquo;d all those Tyrants who in several places
tyrannis&rsquo;ed over the State Ecclesiastical.&nbsp; He
reduc&rsquo;d unto friendship the disunited hearts of the
<i>Romans</i>, particularly, the Families of <i>Colonna</i>,
<i>Orsini</i>, <i>Margoni</i>, and <i>Santa Croce</i>, which were
all embroil&rsquo;d together in civil feuds; and he commanded all
Governours of the State to use their utmost endeavour for
extinguishing all other intestine combustions.</p>
<p>He reduc&rsquo;d all the Kings and Princes of <i>Europe</i> to
an Universal Peace (and believe me, &rsquo;tis little less than a
miracle to unite together so many disunited minds.)&nbsp; And
indeed since the daies of <i>Augustus C&aelig;sar</i>, never was
there seen in <i>Europe</i> so great a peace and concord between
all Princes: who attributed this blessed tranquillity to the
pious intention and good conduct of the <i>Pope</i>.</p>
<p>He brought to pass, that three the most powerful Armies that
ever appeared in the world were rais&rsquo;d for the destruction
of the Turk; two by Land, whereof one was commanded by the
Emperour, the other by the King of <i>Hungary</i>; and the third
was a very mighty Fleet commanded by the <i>Pope</i> in Person,
accompanied with the Kings of <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i>, and
<i>England</i>, besides part of the Colledge of <a
name="page2_88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Cardinals,
and a great number of Princes.</p>
<p>But whilst all things were putting in order, and eight months
of the year allotted for preparation already elapsed, this great
<i>Pope</i> fell sick; and his death shortly ensuing hindered
Christendom from the most glorious expedition that ever was (or
perhaps will be) undertaken against <i>Asia</i>; and so much the
more in that <i>Alexander</i> the Sixth was his Successor.</p>
<p>These examples are alledged by me, to shame those <i>Popes</i>
who are so infinitely strangers to the spirit and qualities of
<i>Innocent</i>.&nbsp; The Church indeed much needs in these
daies such a <i>Pope</i> as he to remedy the innumerable
disorders and scandals which are so dayly multiply&rsquo;d in
<i>Rome</i> and the whole State by this practice of advancing
Nephews.&nbsp; But since the death of that <i>Pope</i> so well
dispos&rsquo;d to do good, there have succeeded in the Papacy a
multitude of Wretches, inclin&rsquo;d to nothing but to do
mischief, and to avert whatever good might accidentally come to
pass.</p>
<p>The chief mischief I find in the Papacy, is, that the unworthy
examples of so many <i>Popes</i> addicted to do hurt to the
Church, far exceeds the good example of <i>Innocent</i>, who hath
had few (or none) like himself, in constant seeking good, and
averting evil, not only from <i>Rome</i>, but also from all
Christendom.</p>
<p>In this present Age, <i>Popes</i> strike in with the most, and
relinquish the fewest; that is, they follow evil because many
have follow&rsquo;d it, and they despise good because they see it
embrac&rsquo;d by few; accounting it better to hazard their lives
amongst a herd of Wolves than to be secure in the company of
Sheep.</p>
<p>Greater mischief could not befall the Church, than that which
hath befaln it through the strange changes either of the Nature
or Disposition of the Successors <a name="page2_89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>of <i>Innocent</i> the eighth, to the
admiration of all but the <i>Popes</i> themselves; who never
wonder at any thing, conceiving that they have authority
sufficient to sanctifie wicked actions.</p>
<p>Now to make a little comparison between the actions of
<i>Innocent</i> the eighth with those of <i>Urban</i> the eighth,
<i>Innocent</i> the tenth and <i>Alexander</i> the seventh, the
three last <i>Popes</i>; it appears that these latter were wholly
bent upon sumptuous Buildings, beautifying of Altars, repairing
of Walls, and other external Ornaments; whereas <i>Innocent</i>
on the contrary slighted all Pomps and Magnificences, seeking
only the substantial and internal good of the Church.&nbsp; The
former plotted from morning to night how to sow division amongst
Princes: but <i>Innocent</i> spent all his nights in considering
how to unite all States and Kingdoms, for the common benefit of
Christendom.</p>
<p>Nor is there much need to believe that the <i>Popes</i>, who
shall succeed <i>Alexander</i>, will be apt to imitate
<i>Innocent</i> the eighth.&nbsp; For in the whole Colledge of
Cardinals &rsquo;tis not possible to find even but one of the
like <i>disposition</i>; and I am confident there may be found
above fifty of the humour of <i>Urban</i>, and above as many more
of that of <i>Innocent</i> the tenth, as also no less number of
that of <i>Alexander</i> the seventh; although there be not in
all much above threescore Cardinals.</p>
<p>They would think it a sin to imitate good Examples for this
reason, if for no other, that they have seen the same imitated by
few.&nbsp; And the truth is, good examples are so scarce, that
the <i>Popes</i> have not had, these forty years, time to seek
them; the same being in a manner hid from their eyes, and
strangers to the City of <i>Rome</i>, from whence goodness seems
utterly <a name="page2_90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>banish&rsquo;d, and wickedness recall&rsquo;d thither
with promise of great rewards.</p>
<p>Great Volumes might be filled with the History of
<i>Sixtus</i> the fourth, who was the man, that first made his
Nephews absolute Lords of the Church: If I should set down all
the good and evil committed by the said <i>Pope</i> during his
Reign.&nbsp; But it would be superfluous, since all the Church
receiv&rsquo;d by that <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> actions, is summarily
contain&rsquo;d in the Introduction and Advancement of his
Nephews.&nbsp; A thing extremely scandalous to all Ages, and
withal so mischievous that &rsquo;tis impossible ever to be laid
aside; in regard the <i>Romans</i> themselves are so
accustom&rsquo;d to it, being like Lepers, that feel neither the
Iron nor the fire which corrodes their bowels.</p>
<p>It comes here into my mind, that travelling once from
<i>Rome</i> to <i>Loretto</i>, in the same Litter with a very
aged <i>Roman</i> Gentleman, I fell to discourse with him about
sundry things pertaining to the Papal Government; and
particularly I had the curiosity to ask him, How it could be
consistent with the spirit of true <i>Romans</i> to suffer so
patiently the Dominion of the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Nephews, who
were so addicted to scrape up wealth, affront most Princes,
overturn all things, and tyrannise both in Temporals and
Spirituals, with an authority so absolute, uncontroulable, and
even contrary to reason, that their Government seems rather
Turkish than Christian?</p>
<p>He answer&rsquo;d me with a smile, <i>That the Romans were
become callous</i>, that is insensible; alluding to their
spirits, which alike endure all things from the hands of Nephews,
who by several waies tend to the destruction of whatever they
meddle with.</p>
<p>God forgive that scandalous resolution of <i>Sixtus</i> <a
name="page2_91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>the fourth
to introduce (I will not say the <i>Nipotismo</i>, but) the
Insolence, Vanity, Ambition, Avarice, and the too great Liberty
of the <i>Nipotismo</i>: For the Church had formerly seen
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Nephews in the <i>Vatican</i>, but not till
then the Vices in their Nephews, which peradventure (if not
without all peradventure) were brought in by the aforesaid
<i>Pope</i> by means of the conniv&rsquo;d-at Liberty which he
suffered his Relations to take, and for that having no regard to
the future, but minding wholly the present, he went in the direct
road to the destruction both of Church and State.</p>
<p>This was that <i>Pope</i>, who made war against the
<i>Colonneses</i>, quarrell&rsquo;d the <i>Venetians</i>, and
committed several other exorbitances, for no other reason but the
sake of his Kindred; who, during his thirteen long years Popedom,
were never any one of them the Authors of least advantage to the
Church, but altogether addicted to spend and spoil, to waste and
poure out their Prodigalities at her cost.</p>
<p>More might be said, but to what purpose is it to rub old sores
whilst every day produces new and fresh occasions of grief and
trouble?</p>
<p>Where are those Primitive times, when the lives of the
Ecclesiasticks were solely dedicated to the publick good, and
they possess&rsquo;d nothing as their own; but whatever was
surplus to what was necessary to sustain Nature, was all disposed
of to the poor, with so holy and overflowing Zeal from the true
fountain of perfect Charity that it refresh&rsquo;d even the very
sight of the beholders?</p>
<p>One of the greatest evils which the <i>Nipotismo</i> hath
constantly caus&rsquo;d hath been their little regard to do good
to the poor.&nbsp; The <i>Romans</i> do and ever have <a
name="page2_92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>observ&rsquo;d (and would to God they had not
observ&rsquo;d throughout all ages) that the least charity is
that which comes from the houses of the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i>
Nephews, who themselves have nothing but what they receive as it
were by a general Alms; which is no sooner got into their
clutches but it becomes transformed into hereditary
Principalities, and into a Revenue not temporal, but perpetual
and eternal.</p>
<p>But methinks they ought at least to cover these substantial
wickednesses with an appearance of good, by giving the poor the
remains of their superfluities; and not suffer them to clamour at
their Palace doors, from whence they are so often driven by the
violence of their servants.</p>
<p>But the truth is, the <i>Romans</i> give so little credit to
the good they should do, having been witnesses themselves to so
much of their ill; that it is not possible for them to believe
that what they give in Alms proceeds from a good and charitable
heart, but from hypocrisie and design.</p>
<p>If there was ever a charitable Cardinal in <i>Rome</i>,
certainly &rsquo;tis Cardinal <i>Francisco</i>, who is indeed the
most Eleemosynary person in the world: which I know, as not only
having seen his publick, but his private Alms.&nbsp; And yet
notwithstanding, there is not a <i>Roman</i> but believes this to
be a meer design, to gain the hearts of those who may be able to
advance him to the Papacy.&nbsp; And to say the truth, The
principal vertue that shined in <i>Alexander</i>, when he was
Cardinal, was the great charity he shewed to the poor, giving
them almost his whole Revenue; which was mention&rsquo;d in
design of his advantage in the Conclave.&nbsp; But he was no
sooner chosen <i>Pope</i> but that humour left him, and ever
after he held for the height of <a name="page2_93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Charity, what he did to enrich his
Kindred, who were indifferently poor, and stood in need enough of
the Alms of the <i>Vatican</i>.</p>
<p>I conclude this Book with affirming, that the mischiefs which
the <i>Nipotismo</i> have occasion&rsquo;d, and still do continue
to the Church, are more easie to be seen with the Eye, than writ
with the Pen; and therefore those who have been at <i>Rome</i>
will have more satisfaction in the reading it, than those to whom
it will be very difficult to be believ&rsquo;d, nay, even to be
conceiv&rsquo;d in their imagination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> difficulties, which the
Ministers of Princes meet with in their treaties with the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Nephews, are so great, that the most refined
Wits and politick Heads of the Universe cannot easily fathom
them; every one losing himself in an Abyss of wonder to see the
Court of <i>Rome</i>, in all her own concerns, and with all
persons, so selfish and singular, whilst she alone glories in the
Title of Universal.</p>
<p>It would be no great matter, if the Nephews would rest
satisfied with embroyling and discomposing the minds only of the
Principal Ministers of State; and <a name="page2_100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>did not likewise make themselves the
unhappy instruments of bringing Treaties and Negotiations of the
greatest weight to irreparable confusion: the ruine whereof must
necessarily draw the consequence of damage to the Pontifical
State, disorder to Christianity, and perpetual distaste to those
Princes, who know themselves obliged to send their Agents to a
Court, where they shall rather receive occasion of disgust than
profit.&nbsp; For the Church-men cannot treat with any Prince,
without wounding his reputation with secret reproaches and
back-biting language.</p>
<p>There are two things, Ignorance and malice (the usual
Patrimony of <i>Popes</i> Nephews) which are predominant in the
<i>Nipotismo</i>, which subvert and drown even those appearances
of good, that might otherwise be found in the Court of
<i>Rome</i>: And the mischief of it is, that these two are
inseparable, and go alwaies hand in hand together in the
<i>Nipotismo</i>; their ignorance is not accompanied with that
honest simplicity which often is seen in some of weak
understanding; but quite contrary, an ignorant Nephew no sooner
marches into the <i>Vatican</i> (which thing God knows too often
happens) but Artificial Malice displaies her Banners; and if by
chance within the Camp there happens to be found out any one
that&rsquo;s good and vertuous, she doth her utmost to make him
pass for an ignorant lackwit.&nbsp; Whence the Church,
Christendom, and the Court do all suffer by the malice and
ignorance of those Lordly Nephews, who matter not by which of
these two abject qualities they govern.</p>
<p>There have been several Princes in our Age, who finding
themselves deluded in some of their affairs, have blam&rsquo;d
their own Officers, judging the errors <a
name="page2_101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>which
occasioned their damage, and were indeed committed by the
<i>Nipotismo</i>, to be caused by the inability of their
Ministers; as if it had been in their power to overwhelm the
Course of nature, and thwart a malicious Ignorance.</p>
<p><i>Odoardo Farnese</i>, Duke of <i>Parma</i>, a Prince truly
worthy of a Crown, seeing the business of <i>Castro</i>, and his
other Affairs with the Church, not to succeed according to his
desire, rebuked his Minister who was at <i>Rome</i>, believing
him a person of very slender experience in the management of the
matters committed to his charge.</p>
<p>But when it hapned that his occasions drew himself thither,
and consequently oblig&rsquo;d him to treate personally with the
Nephews of <i>Pope Urban</i>, he speedily reform&rsquo;d the ill
impression made in his mind against his Ministers, knowing then
very well, by his own experience, that all the damages, he
sustain&rsquo;d in that affair, were derived from the ill-will
was borne him by the <i>Barberini</i>: Whereupon as he went from
<i>Rome</i> he let these words fall, <i>That the Church indeed is
a holy body</i>, <i>of which the Princes are the Members</i>,
<i>and the</i> Pope <i>the Head</i>; <i>but the Nephews by their
ill management do daily discompose the Members</i>, <i>not at all
regarding how thereby they prejudiced the Head</i>.</p>
<p>And to say the truth, the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Nephews cannot
oftentimes distinguish, what difference there is betwixt a Prince
and his Minister; nor what respect the Court ought to shew to
them which come to honour it.</p>
<p>The Church-mens understanding, to accommodate the Church so
well to the benefit of their proper interest, makes many believe
the subtilty of them in politick affairs to be very great.&nbsp;
And truly, the conceipt <a name="page2_102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>is not ordinary, which most men have
of the politick understanding of the Ecclesiasticks; every one
knowing that the City of <i>Rome</i>, in the Art of Governing and
making others reasons conform to its will, hath ever been in all
times and ages the truest School of Policy, and almost, if not
altogether, the Mistris of all Nations: as she who, at her birth
from the belly of the rest by a special gift of nature, brought
with her into the world the most polite Endowments and refined
Customs she could bestow upon her.</p>
<p>Such were alwaies the Customs of <i>Rome</i>, who for the
space of more than twelve Ages past, knew very well to frame
conformable maximes to their own designs.&nbsp; But after that
the <i>Nipotismo</i> began to take possession of an Authority,
not limited otherwise than by their own passions, every thing
began to put on a new countenance.&nbsp; And having renounced the
true and ancient Rules of Government, and found new methods of
deport to those who make addresses to them, the Agents and
Ministers of Foraign Princes, who come thither to negotiate their
Masters affairs, mistake the way that others use to walk in with
so much reputation.</p>
<p>From whence it happens, that there are very few return from
their Negotiations there without just occasion of complaint; not
only that they have not met with due civilities, but that they
have likewise been deluded in all their transactions.</p>
<p>The Court of <i>Rome</i> indeed, whilst the <i>Popes</i>
liv&rsquo;d without the <i>Nipotismo</i>, were instrumental in
the world to resolve the greatest intricacies of Christendom: but
after they were introduced, they served only to confound and
entangle the easiest matters; who interposing in things not at
all concerning them, <a name="page2_103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>they ruin&rsquo;d others business
and affairs, besides their own.&nbsp; For they will do nothing
now in <i>Rome</i> without pretence of perfect Zeal unto
Religion; and yet that Zeal hath certainly the least shew in any
of their concerns.&nbsp; Good serves them only for the shadow,
but Evil for the substance.&nbsp; Kindnesses from them, as honey
from Bees, being seldom got without the sting of prejudice.</p>
<p>There are some that have fansied the Courting and flattering
the <i>Nipotismo</i> to be the only way to arrive at the end of
their unbridled designs, but these found themselves deceived; for
all the merit or other insinuation in the world is not able to
move the obstinacy of those who (except it proceed from some
capricious fancie or other inclination of their own) have no
regard to remunerate or gratifie either Subject, Prince, or
Prelate.</p>
<p>Yet it is more easie to obtain, than keep their favours: But
he that doth, had better be without them: since &rsquo;tis so
hard to judge whether the Tap they draw their favours from be
sweet or sower.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis hard to express the difficulties the Ministers of
Princes meet with in their treating with the Nephews; which are
so great, that some of them have caused an infinitie of Masses to
be celebrated to the Holy Ghost, before they began their
Negotiations with them.&nbsp; I my self knew one, who vowed to
make himself a <i>Capuchin Frier</i>, if he could effect a
certain business with them; but I believe he had no great
intention to put on that habit, because his demand was for his
own advantage, and the Nephews are never wont to grant any thing
to any one, but what is to their prejudice.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis my opinion, that to be well prepared to treate <a
name="page2_104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>in
<i>Rome</i>, one ought to be well provided of that double spirit,
which <i>Elisha</i> so earnestly desired of <i>Elijah</i>, whilst
double dealing and hypocrisie are the chiefest rudiments of their
Policy, I will not say that now do, but, for the space of two
Ages past, have reigned in <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>Let the Agents and Ministers of Princes therefore lay their
heads together in <i>Rome</i>, and say Masses to obtain new waies
of managing Political Affairs, let them arm themselves with a
double spirit; for the Pontificial Negotiations will try the
skill of the most experienced Statesmen.</p>
<p><i>Venice</i>, that with so great prudence in State-affairs
foresees the future, never sends any Embassadour to <i>Rome</i>,
that hath not first been tried, and rendered an incomparable
Politician by the experience he hath gotten in the Courts of the
chiefest Monarchies of the Universe: yet notwithstanding I my
self have heard these words said by an Embassadour sent to
<i>Rome</i> from thence: <i>Sin hora sono stato nell Ambasciate
scabrose</i>, <i>hora entro nelle pericolose</i>, <i>dio me la
mandi buona conquel Nipotismo</i>: Till now I have been in rugged
Treaties, now I enter into a dangerous one: God send me good luck
with the <i>Nipotismo</i>.</p>
<p>He, who can live five years in the Court of <i>Rome</i>
without a stumble, will not find it hard to pass an Age or two
(if nature would give him leave) in any other place with
reputation and credit.</p>
<p>Yet we know very well by every daies experience, that many
Politicians and expert Statesmen, who, for many years together in
the management of several Treaties, had rendered themselves as it
were immortal by the no small reputation obtained in the several
Courts they had been formerly employed in, no <a
name="page2_105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>sooner
came to <i>Rome</i>, but speedily they lost it.&nbsp; And indeed
they all come thither swell&rsquo;d with the Titles of most
eminent and able Statesmen, but depart from thence with very
little credit.</p>
<p>And the reason of this is, because as the Sea Coast, which
encompasses the Ecclesiastick State, is subject to the usual
Tempests of the Ocean; so the <i>Roman</i> Havens are very
subject to their sudden variations and changes: From whence it
happens, that both without and within <i>Rome</i> is so subject
to perils and ship-wracks.&nbsp; They therefore who go for
succour to that Climate, that is not understood by those
themselves that are born under it, cannot but meet with storms
and tempests.&nbsp; Where affairs put on every day a several face
and shape, the difficulty must needs be very great; And many
Ministers lose themselves in the Court of <i>Rome</i> by this
means.&nbsp; For when they believe they Negotiate with a
Monarchy, they find they have to do with a Republick; and when
they think they treat with a Commonwealth, they find they are
ingaged with a Monarchy full of Monarchs, whilst there is not one
of the Papal Nephews that doth not expect to be treated, with as
a Soveraign.</p>
<p>Yet because the <i>Pope</i> is chosen by the Cardinals, many
would believe that these have the same Authority with the
<i>Pope</i>, not only to treat, but conclude; as the Electors
have with the Emperour in Affairs of great importance.&nbsp; And
indeed, to hear his Holiness call them Fellows, Companions, and
Brethren, makes a strange impression in the Citizens, Strangers,
Subjects, and Princes, of I know not what greatness in favour of
the Cardinals, every one imagining that they cannot chuse but
have a share in the privatest concerns of the Government of the
Church.</p>
<p><a name="page2_106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>But
for all that things appear quite otherwise, and the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> become absolute Soveraign over those who
chuse him; who never know any thing in any affairs untill they
are concluded on: He sends Embassadours at his will, treats both
of Peace and War at his own pleasure, and in fine, doth
whatsoever he hath a mind to, without participating it to any,
but those to whom he is guided to by his particular
inclinations.</p>
<p>But that, which makes the treating with the Court of
<i>Rome</i> more difficult, is, That for the most part the
<i>Pope</i> himself neither understands the Negotiations, nor
Negotiators of them.&nbsp; And the Ministers of Princes sometimes
as little know which is the <i>Pope</i>, for frequently he treats
as Nephew, and the Nephews treat as <i>Pope</i>.&nbsp; A thing
indeed enough to confound any ones understanding, to have the
Pontificacy so promiscuously made up of <i>Pope</i> and Nephews;
He for the Exteriour, and they for the Interiour part of it.</p>
<p>For the <i>Nipotismo</i>, which manageth publick affairs, at
whose Girdle the Keys of business are tied, Resolves, Negotiates,
and concludes any thing without acquainting either the
<i>Pope</i> or Consistory.</p>
<p>Let any one judge, how it was possible for any Embassadour to
make any honourable result in the management of the interests of
his Prince at <i>Rome</i> in the time of <i>Gregory</i> the
fifteenth; since he himself was so fearful to displease Cardinal
<i>Ludovisi</i>, his Nephew, that he suffered him to do whatever
he had a mind to: who, finding the power he had over him, did
every thing without his knowledge.</p>
<p>There were some Embassadours who in their ordinary Visits
would in general terms touch upon <a name="page2_107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>business, only to feel his Holiness
his Pulse, which way he was enclined.&nbsp; But so soon as ever
he perceived them to begin to ask Questions, he would immediately
make this Answer; <i>You speak with us</i>, <i>and our Nephew
doth all things without either us or you</i>; <i>speak with
him</i>, <i>and what he doth</i>, <i>that we do</i>.&nbsp; And
with such like answers he usually entertained those Embassadors
that came to him.</p>
<p>From hence it came to pass, that most of the Treaties did not
only confound those who managed them; but also the Ministers
found themselves obliged to put all their affairs upon Chance,
Fineness and Policy standing them in little stead, who were
necessitated, as a Ship in an unruly storm, to give themselves up
altogether to Fortune.</p>
<p>It was a thing worth the observing, to see how the
Embassadours laboured both with bodies and mind, sometimes on
this, sometimes on that side; now with the Nephews, then with the
<i>Pope</i>; from one drawing this Answer, <i>Speak to our
Uncle</i>: From the other, <i>Go to our Nephew</i>.&nbsp; So that
very often when they concluded any thing with the Nephew, they
were in doubt whether or no the Uncle would be contented: And so
it hapned on the other side, if they treated any thing with the
Uncle, they were ever fearful least the other, being displeased
at it, should cross the whole design; so that though matters were
concluded by either of these, they were still uncertain whether
the result would be for good or evil.</p>
<p>This Nephew, who did every thing without the knowledge of his
Uncle, gave out, he could do nothing without participating to
others; and particularly in the beginning the Papacy he alwaies
answered, in affairs of greatest concernment, <i>We will see</i>,
<a name="page2_108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span><i>We
will do</i>, <i>We will speak</i>, <i>We will procure</i>, <i>We
will consent</i>, and such like dilatory expressions.</p>
<p>And the Embassadours were most mortified with this manner of
proceedings of the <i>Pope</i> and his Nephews, who knew very
well how to agree amongst themselves to the prejudice of those
who treated with them.&nbsp; And when things did not go on
according to their pleasures, or they found themselves unable to
resist the perswasions and arguments of the Embassadours, they
would both sing in the same tune: The holy Colledge of Cardinals
must be acquainted with the affair, without whom there was never
any thing concluded.</p>
<p>And yet those Ministers themselves knew very well, that was
but a false pretext; for although the Cardinals were in
<i>Rome</i>, yet they were not in the Court, and never knew of
the designs of the <i>Pope</i>, nor the Treaties of his
Nephew.</p>
<p>In <i>Urban&rsquo;s</i> time there were other Labyrinths in
the Court, although this <i>Pope</i> was a far greater Politician
than <i>Gregory</i>, and the <i>Barbarins</i> much more expert in
Government than the abovesaid Cardinal <i>Ludovisio</i>.</p>
<p>At that time, before any thing could be done, all the Nephews
favours must be purchased; for he was resolved not to treat with
any that was not dependent on his Family.&nbsp; And not only
<i>Francesco</i>, the Cardinal <i>Patrone</i>, was to be courted,
but Cardinal <i>Antonio</i>, and <i>Don Tadeo</i>, and his Wife
likewise, who so aspired at the Visits of the Ministers of
Princes, that the <i>Pope</i> would not give Audience to any that
had not first paid his devoir to that Lady: which was the Reason,
why the Duke of <i>Parma</i> had such ill success in all his
business.</p>
<p><a name="page2_109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>In
the beginning of his Reign the <i>Pope</i>, in a manner alone,
manag&rsquo;d all the most important affairs of Christendom, with
no small ardency and zeal.&nbsp; But wot you what?&nbsp; The
things which he did in the day he undid in the night; for coming
to consult with his Nephews, who alwaies found their
Uncle&rsquo;s Opinion contrary to their own, they oftentimes
brought him to contradict himself, and reverse what he had
formerly granted and concluded.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis true, he did this with great subtlety, not failing
to find out some fair and specious excuses wherewith to colour
their pretexts, and clear the <i>Pope</i> of levity; by which
means Embassadours were perpetually deluded, even when they
thought they had the Fish in their hands, which on a sudden slipt
away from between their fingers, beyond possibility of
recovery.</p>
<p>Hence affairs were protracted <i>in infinitum</i>; So that
though in <i>Urban&rsquo;s</i> time many Princes treated of a
League with the Church and the <i>Pope</i> himself, nevertheless
there was not any considerable one concluded in a Reign of twenty
three years; during which time divers Princes concluded a League
offensive and defensive against the <i>Barbarini</i>.</p>
<p>The reason of this was, for that the <i>Pope</i> was too hard
towards others, and too soft towards his own Relations; Cardinal
<i>Francesco</i> too soft towards others, (but dissemblingly) and
hard towards his Uncle; Cardinal <i>Antonio</i> hard towards
<i>Francesco</i>, and soft towards the <i>Pope</i>; and <i>Don
Thadeo</i>, who knew not how to do better, was hard towards the
soft, and soft towards the hard.</p>
<p>Cardinal <i>Francesco</i> fear&rsquo;d to disgust
<i>Antonio</i>, and delighted to displease the <i>Pope</i>;
Cardinal <i>Antonio</i> fear&rsquo;d the <i>Pope</i>, but
caus&rsquo;d <i>Francesco</i> fear himself; <a
name="page2_110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span><i>Don
Thadeo</i> sided with him that was most obstinate in his opinion;
And the <i>Pope</i> deny&rsquo;d to one what he could not grant
to the other, granted to this what the other desired, becoming
obstinate where there was need of pliableness, and pliable where
it behoved him to be obstinate.</p>
<p>Now a Court of this humour afforded work enough to the
Ministers of Princes, who were alwaies receiv&rsquo;d by the
<i>Pope</i> with ambiguous expressions, by Cardinal
<i>Francesco</i> with abundance of faire promises, and by
Cardinal <i>Antonio</i> with a long train of exquisite
complements.&nbsp; But when the Ministers press&rsquo;d to come
to a conclusion of any important business, Cardinal
<i>Antonio</i> sent them to his brother <i>Francesco</i>, who at
the appointed hour of Audience us&rsquo;d to go his visits to the
seven Churches, and the <i>Pope</i> himself pretended
indisposition of body.&nbsp; And thus the effecting of all urgent
business was rendred impossible.</p>
<p>In <i>Urban&rsquo;s</i> time &rsquo;twas hard for Princes
Ministers to find the streight gate to enter into publick
Negotiations, and when they were in, they found themselves in a
Labyrinth, out of which they could scarce extricate themselves
after a thousand turnings and windings.</p>
<p><i>Monsieur de Lionne</i>, a person of great Abilities, being
employ&rsquo;d Embassadour to <i>Rome</i> by the most Christian
Crown, one day ask&rsquo;d a familiar friend of his (pleasantly)
<i>What kind of person himself had</i>?&nbsp; To which his Friend
answered.&nbsp; <i>That he had the person of a man worthy of this
Age</i>.&nbsp; Monsieur <i>de Lionne</i> reply&rsquo;d to him,
<i>That he took himself to be like a Tennis-ball bandi&rsquo;d to
and fro by foul-players</i>; alluding hereby to the Artifices and
tricks put upon him by the <i>Barbarini</i> <a
name="page2_111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>in his
negotiating with them concerning the affair of <i>Castro</i>.</p>
<p>The truth is, any other Minister but Monsieur <i>de Lionne</i>
would have shewed much anger in <i>Rome</i>, in the time of the
War of the Duke of <i>Parma</i> with the confederate
Princes.&nbsp; This great Man, who was dispatch&rsquo;d on
purpose to procure the appeasing of the rising tumults, knew not
which way to turn his wits to invent projects and artifices
enough to oppose those of the <i>Barbarini</i>, who continually
promis&rsquo;d what they never intended to perform.</p>
<p>He was sent from <i>Herod</i> to <i>Pilate</i>, and from
<i>Pilate</i> to <i>Caiphas</i>: The one answer&rsquo;d,
<i>Yea</i>: The other, <i>No</i>.&nbsp; But what was most
important, the <i>Pope</i> had granted him leave to treat with
the two Cardinals his Nephews, with a promise to confirm what
should be by them concluded.&nbsp; Hereupon having one day by the
power of perswasions reduc&rsquo;d the said two Lords to reason,
he repair&rsquo;d to the <i>Pope</i> to beseech him to confirm
the Treaties agreed upon with his Nephews; but he receiv&rsquo;d
for answer, <i>That &rsquo;twas expedient to consider upon the
matter</i>; which consideration never had an end.</p>
<p>All the Policy of the <i>Barbarini</i> lay in drawing out
affairs in length, and concluding nothing; so that when ever
these Nephews concluded any thing with the Ministers of Princes,
they presently sent word to the <i>Pope</i>, that he should deny
to confirm what they had done, and at the same time gave out that
such denial was contrary to their wills.</p>
<p>The Republick of <i>Venice</i>, when they saw that ancient
Monument remov&rsquo;d out of the <i>Vatican</i>, which
represented the Benefits done by St. <i>Mark</i> to the Church,
sent an Express to carry their just complaints <a
name="page2_112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>to the
<i>Pope</i>, but he could never obtain any kind of satisfaction,
not so much as in words, the <i>Pope</i> turning the matter from
himself to his Nephews, and the Nephews from themselves to the
<i>Pope</i>.</p>
<p>In the mean time great affront was done to the honour of a
Republick so well deserving of the Church, without which one may
say perhaps there would not be now a <i>Pope</i> in <i>Rome</i>,
if any where else.</p>
<p>In like manner the Commonwealth of <i>Lucca</i> sent an
Embassadour to <i>Rome</i> to complain of the injury done to them
by the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> sending to them the Lord
<i>Recagna</i> with the title of Commissary, (which was a thing
not a little derogatory from the Soveraignty of that State) and
the more, in that this good Prelate, sent from the
<i>Barbarini</i>, had something of the Barbarian.</p>
<p>But this Embassage had no effect, besides a return of Plenary
Indulgency, which the Embassadour carried home, who seeing
himself so often baffled at the <i>Vatican</i>, fell into the
humour of negotiating with the Saints, and made his business to
receive the Stations sometimes of one Church, and sometimes of
another.</p>
<p>The Crown of <i>Poland</i> for six years together solicited by
its Embassadour to have a Cardinal&rsquo;s Hat for the Lord
<i>Visconti</i>, according to his just Priviledges; but in all
that time he not only could not obtain his intent; but moreover
the Popish Embassadour at his return knew not what cause to tell
his Master of the denial; for they all gave him good words, and
bad deeds.&nbsp; Cardinal <i>Antonio</i> excus&rsquo;d himself by
saying, <i>That he had no authority to effect it</i>; Cardinal
<i>Francesco</i>, <i>That his desire was to serve his
Majesty</i>, <i>but his Holiness did not think the Person
worthy</i>; And the <a name="page2_113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span><i>Pope</i> pretended, <i>That he
could not make a man Cardinal who was an enemy to his
Nephews</i>.</p>
<p>The same was the case of the Citizens of <i>Bononia</i>, who
dispatch&rsquo;d an Agent to <i>Rome</i>, to supplicate his
Holiness, that he would please to remove the Commissary <i>Della
Grascia</i>, whose being there mightily intrench&rsquo;d upon
their Priviledges, but they receiv&rsquo;d the same Answer with
those of <i>Lucca</i>; their Envoy returning laden with fair
words, but not with Indulgences, as he of <i>Lucca</i>; for out
of displeasure to have miss&rsquo;d his intent he would not visit
the holy places, but said to a Friend that moved him to go and
receive the Stations of St. <i>Mary Maggiore</i>, (rather like a
Protestant than a Catholick) <i>My Friend</i>, <i>If there be no
treating with the</i> Barbarini <i>who can speak</i>, <i>there is
less with the Saints who cannot</i>.&nbsp; <i>To what purpose is
it to solicite the dead</i>, <i>if it be so hard to address to
the living</i>?</p>
<p>The two Crowns of <i>France</i> and <i>Spain</i> are
manifestly imposed upon every day, the <i>Spanish</i> Policy
little availing with the <i>Barbarini</i>, whilst they stir not a
hairs breadth from their ordinary Maxime, which is to perplex the
understanding of Embassadours, one of them denying as much as the
other promis&rsquo;d.&nbsp; Which gave occasion to a certain
<i>Florentine</i> of the great Duke&rsquo;s Court to say, <i>That
the greatest miracle of</i> Rome <i>was to see all the Ministers
of Princes tantaliz&rsquo;d with the ambiguous and confus&rsquo;d
treating of the</i> Barbarini, <i>to so great prejudice of all
Christendom</i>.</p>
<p>But if ever any Prince was tantalized by them, &rsquo;twas the
King of <i>Portugal</i>, who by the advice of <i>France</i>, and
upon hopes given by the fair words of the <i>Barbarini</i>, sent
the Bishop of <i>Lamego</i> with the title of Embassadour Royal
to <i>Rome</i>, where he was receiv&rsquo;d <a
name="page2_114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>with
great honour and respect.&nbsp; But in substance &rsquo;twas all
but smoke, the Embassadour being unable to obtain either a
favourable Yea, or a flat No; that I say not that he
obtain&rsquo;d sometimes the one, and sometimes the other.</p>
<p>This intricate procedure in so important a matter was the
cause of great disorders, the <i>Spaniards</i> distrusting the
words of the <i>Barbarini</i>, and the <i>French</i> giving
little or no credit to the offers made by them.&nbsp; For
Cardinal <i>Antonio</i> never ceas&rsquo;d to assure
<i>France</i>, <i>That</i> Lamego <i>should not fail to be
receiv&rsquo;d as a publick Embassadour</i>; and Cardinal
<i>Francesco</i> continually promis&rsquo;d <i>Spain</i>, <i>That
his Holiness would never admit a Portugal Embassadour</i>.</p>
<p>And accordingly by this course the <i>Barbarini</i> wholly
disgusted the <i>Portugal</i>, little satisfied the
<i>Spaniard</i>, and nothing at all the <i>French</i>, and
brought the City it self into danger by that fray which
happen&rsquo;d between the two Embassadours, with the death of
some Courtiers on both sides, and the declaring <i>Lamego</i>
irregular and depriv&rsquo;d of all Ecclesiastical Benefices,
according to the usual penalty of Homicide.</p>
<p>A thousand other Examples might be brought of like nature, but
I must omit them to pass on to the actions of <i>Innocent</i> the
tenth, who had reduc&rsquo;d the Court to such a confus&rsquo;d
state, that no body knew where, nor how, to begin any
Negotiation; whereupon a Minister of the Duke of <i>Parma</i>
said one day, <i>That &rsquo;twas easier to make a bed for a
dog</i>, <i>than to understand the humour of</i> Innocent.</p>
<p>The Government of <i>Urban</i> was the best in the World in
comparison of that of <i>Innocent</i>; for <i>Urban</i> delighted
to negotiate with Embassadours, but the <a
name="page2_115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>other
avoided their presence as much as possible he could; and when he
receiv&rsquo;d them, &rsquo;twas after so disobliging careless
manner, that few car&rsquo;d to confer with him.</p>
<p>No hours were so tedious to him, as those wherein he was to
give Audience to a publick Embassadour; for he little car&rsquo;d
to be troubled with the important affairs of Christendom, or
those of the Papacy it self.</p>
<p>His particular Maximes were to deny all favours, to answer all
sutes with a Negative, and never to resolve upon any thing that
might advantage the Church, or weaken its Enemies.</p>
<p>What others avoided, was in him predominant; that is to say,
He lov&rsquo;d that which was worst.&nbsp; If he possess&rsquo;d
any vertue, he employ&rsquo;d it not to the benefit of
Christendom, but of his own Family; as on the contrary he did his
ill qualities to the mischief of the Church and the City.</p>
<p>At first indeed he seem&rsquo;d so desirous of knowing all
affairs both publick and private, that &rsquo;twas hoped, his
Government would prove the happiest that ever was to the
Church.&nbsp; But this vigilance caused no small hurt in general;
for when the Subjects of the Ecclesiastical State, Prelates, and
forreign Ministers, conceiving the same to proceed from zeal to
Justice, had brought and delivered their Memorials, in hopes of a
speedy Answer, it prov&rsquo;d all but loss of time; for they
never were call&rsquo;d, nor admitted to any answer at all.&nbsp;
Whence, the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> way, of denying all and resolving
nothing, being understood, it became an ungrateful employment to
have any thing to do at <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>And to make the way of arriving at their ends <a
name="page2_116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>more
difficult to Princes Ministers, for a long time together there
was no Officer at Court to present the Petitions of Suiters, as
formerly, but he declared one of his Nephews to be Cardinal
Patron; who was the Cardinal <i>Astalli</i>, but with an
authority so streight and limited, that he was almost
asham&rsquo;d of it.</p>
<p>By this means the Court became so much the more at a loss; for
such as address&rsquo;d to this Nephew, receiv&rsquo;d no other
comfort, but to behold him shrink up his shoulders, (as young
maids do when ask&rsquo;d by their Fathers whether they will
marry) and hear him tell them, <i>That all should be represented
to his Holiness</i>.&nbsp; And the truth is, as to this point he
was very punctual: But he did it after so timerous and
indifferent a manner, out of fear to cross the <i>Pope</i>, whose
answer he knew was alwaies the same, <i>That the matter shall be
taken into consideration</i>; The plain meaning whereof was,
<i>That nothing at all shall be done in it</i>.</p>
<p>In this confusion some thought it best to address immediately
to the <i>Pope</i>; but, besides the difficulty of Access, the
Event prov&rsquo;d alwaies alike; whatever care they took to make
their Proposals clear and intelligible, they alwaies hung in the
hedge.&nbsp; Yet there were some too that fansied <i>Innocent</i>
one of the greatest Politicians of the World, till perceiving by
effects the clean contrary, they remain&rsquo;d as mute as
Statues for shame of their mistake.</p>
<p>His suffering <i>Donna Olympia</i> to rule all, his exalting,
and abasing his adopted Nephew <i>Astalli</i>; his banishing, and
recalling <i>Don Camillo</i> his own Nephew; his persecuting, and
reingraciating with the <i>Barbarini</i>; and in a word, his
changing his will and judgment every moment; and his inconstancy
in every thing, <a name="page2_117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>save granting Sutes, would have imbroiled any
Government whatsoever, and much more the Papal, which is
naturally full of confusion.</p>
<p>When there happens a <i>Pope</i> like <i>Innocent</i>, bent
wholly to reject all the instances of Princes; the only remedy is
to sow disturbances in the Church, and broyls between the
Protestants and Catholicks, thereby to puzzle the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> brain, and frighten him, so that he shall
rather seek the friendship of Princes, than they his.&nbsp; Of
the success of which course I shall give some Examples.</p>
<p>When the Duke of <i>Parma&rsquo;s</i> Army took the Field, to
get redress concerning the detension of <i>Castro</i>, under the
Command of <i>Don Gauffrido</i>; the <i>Pope</i> extremely
affrighted, as one not much accustomed to the Trade of War,
caused the Holy Sacrament to be expos&rsquo;d forty hours, and
Processions to be celebrated to all the Churches in
<i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>And not knowing what might be the issue of the War undertaken
by the said Prince, who breathed nothing but the extremities
thereof against his Person, he thought it his best course to gain
the Princes of <i>Christendom</i> to his side, and to oblige them
to relinquish the Protection of the Duke, by rendring himself
extraordinary easie to all Addresses, granting Favours to all
Demanders, and receiving Publick Ministers with so much
obligingness, that they needed no more but to open their mouths
for any Suit or Request, that of the <i>Pope</i> standing always
open to accord it.</p>
<p>A certain Embassador, who for three years together could never
obtain any other Favour but that of Common Indulgences, finding
his desires now satisfied in what ever he demanded, writ to the
Prince <a name="page2_118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>his Master, <i>That the</i> Pope, <i>like a
Hackney-horse</i>, <i>travelled very well with a Spur in his
Flank</i>; <i>and that he had lately obtained</i>, <i>in eight
days</i>, <i>more than he could do before in three years</i>:
<i>So that it were to be wish&rsquo;d that the Duke of</i> Parma
<i>would give him a touch or two more of the Spur</i>.</p>
<p>In the very same manner, at the time that the <i>French</i>
had made themselves Masters of <i>Portolongone</i>, all sort of
Favours ran out with a full torrent, many times preventing
Requests: Nor did the <i>Pope</i> suffer any man to depart from
his Presence, who was not satisfied to the height of his
wishes.</p>
<p>But no sooner was this State of Affairs changed, that is to
say, <i>Portolongone</i> recovered by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and
the Duke disappointed in the War, but Negatives appear&rsquo;d
afresh in the Field with greater peremptoriness than before; and
the <i>Pope</i> became as deaf as a Stone to all manner of
Supplications or Petitions.</p>
<p>Hence it may be clearly seen, or at least argu&rsquo;d, That
most <i>Popes</i> (if not all) neither grant Favours, nor bear
any regard to Princes, save at such time as they stand in need of
them.</p>
<p><i>Urban</i> the Eighth was of this very same humour, denying
without exception all sort of Favours, which had not their
original from his own or his Nephews inclination, however just
Reasons might be alledged for them; and this as well to the
<i>French</i>, whom he made semblance to love, but really
lov&rsquo;d not; as to the <i>Spaniards</i>, whom indeed he
affected, though without giving them the satisfaction of seeing
any tokens of that affection.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when he saw <i>Odoardo Farnese</i> Duke of
<i>Parma</i> enter victorious with 3000 Horse, for the <a
name="page2_119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>regaining
of <i>Castro</i>, most injuriously detained from him, then indeed
he began both to humble himself to <i>Spain</i>, which he had
kept under before, and to gratifie <i>France</i>, to which he had
on divers occasions shewn himself ungrateful; and also to
solicite the Friendship of all sort of Princes, as well small as
great; and that not by promising, but by real concession of
Favours with a plentiful hand in <i>Germany</i> and
<i>Italy</i>.</p>
<p>Wherefore seeing the <i>Popes</i> have a particular Method of
bearing themselves ruggedly and contemptuously to Princes, when
they need them not; &rsquo;twere good Policy in Princes to bring
it so to pass, that they might always be in a state of Fear,
sometimes by threatning neer hand, and at other times by vexing
them at distance.</p>
<p>The Indignities which Princes receive often from the Court of
<i>Rome</i>, proceed not immediately from an evil intention in
the <i>Popes</i> towards them, but from the too good inclination
of Princes towards the <i>Popes</i>; there being some so
tender-conscienc&rsquo;d, that they fear the loss of their Souls
in disgusting a rascallion Court-fly that bears the Cassock of a
Priest, and serves to sweep the Antichamber of his Holiness or
the Cardinal-Nephew.</p>
<p>The Ecclesiasticks have Swords in their Mouths, but no Courage
in their Breasts; I mean, they threaten all People, without
considering what issue such Menaces may have: But when they see
themselves reprov&rsquo;d or threatned, then their hearts fail
them, they fall a trembling, and humble themselves to every body,
especially Grandees; although withall, they have the cunning to
colour their Fear with the pretext of a religious, pious, and
devout Meekness.</p>
<p><a name="page2_120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>The
nature of the Ecclesiasticks is to disgust such as comply with
them, and fawn on those that disgust them; So that if Princes
would advance their Affairs, and bring down the haughtiness of
<i>Rome</i>, they must endeavour to mortifie the <i>Pope</i>.</p>
<p>The Catholick Crown, in testimony of its affection to the
<i>Popes</i>, admits into its Jurisdiction only the <i>Roman</i>
Religion; besides that the <i>Spaniards</i> also shew themselves
most concerned in keeping up the <i>Pope</i> the Head of the
Church, and enriching the Ecclesiasticks.</p>
<p>However, they have fared little or not at all the better for
it, as to their Negotiations at <i>Rome</i>, in regard that the
Ecclesiasticks (that is, the <i>Popes</i>) esteem them not more
than others for it; but through fear commonly afford as much or
more countenance to the <i>French</i>: from whom on the other
side they receive greater disgusts, under pretence of the
<i>Gallican</i> Priviledges.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis true, the <i>Roman</i> Court very well perceives,
that the <i>Spaniards</i> reverence it as the Sanctuary of their
Glory, and the Absolute Mistress of the preservation of their
States; and accordingly it treats them familiarly, that is to
say, with good words and ill deeds, with fair shews and bad
substance.</p>
<p>The <i>Spaniards</i> suffering themselves to be too much
domineer&rsquo;d over in the Court of <i>Rome</i>, is not only
hurtful to the Government of the <i>Spaniards</i> themselves, but
also thereby prejudices the Interests of all those Princes that
have concerns either at <i>Rome</i>, or with <i>Rome</i>; For
when any inferiour Prince would with specious Reasons defend his
Right over Ecclesiastical Persons, these men presently alledge
for their justification the Example of the <i>Spaniards</i>, and
thereby <a name="page2_121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>enforce him not to refuse, what so great and powerful a
Monarchy as <i>Spain</i> refuseth not to do.&nbsp; And of these
Examples the <i>Popes</i> have the <i>Vatican</i> full, and make
use of the same in all Occurrences, to the perpetual nauseating
of Princes therewith.</p>
<p>This manner of proceeding between the Ecclesiasticks and the
<i>Spaniards</i> cannot last long, because the long languishings
of Princes, ensuing thereupon, will enforce them either to yield
to some violent Remedy, or to open the gate to death.</p>
<p>Every day, yea, every moment, displeasures arise between the
Crown of <i>Spain</i> and <i>Rome</i>; which, how-much soever
debated, turn always to the satisfaction of the <i>Pope</i>, and
the disadvantage of the Interests of the Catholick King.</p>
<p>In brief, The Dominion which the Court of <i>Rome</i> hath
gotten over the <i>Spaniards</i> is so great, that how many and
considerable soever the disgusts be which this Court puts upon
them from day to day, nevertheless the <i>Spaniards</i> dare not
come to a Rupture with it, being better contented to suffer
themselves, than to make others suffer.</p>
<p>The Policy of the <i>North</i>, yea and that of <i>Italy</i>
too, laughs at this <i>Spanish</i> Zeal, which stoops in so
humble sort to the arrogance and insolent Proceedings of the
Ecclesiasticks.&nbsp; And indeed What reason is there that such a
Monarchy should submit its Empire to a simple Bishoprick?&nbsp;
Nevertheless, this is seen done every day in the Ecclesiastick
State.</p>
<p>Were it not for the <i>Spaniards</i>, I verily believe Affairs
at <i>Rome</i> would not be so imbroil&rsquo;d and
perplex&rsquo;d as they are; for the <i>Popes</i> become so
extremely proud towards other Princes, and render all
Negotiations so extremely difficult, through the little account
they <a name="page2_122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>make of Publick Ministers, in regard they see
themselves back&rsquo;d and supported by so potent a Crown in
<i>Italy</i>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I cannot but imagine, That other Princes are for
this reason extremely incensed with anger against the
<i>Spaniards</i>, who to satisfie an apparent out-side Zeal,
ruine the Common Cause of the Sovereignty of all other
Princes.</p>
<p>If the <i>Spaniards</i> would comply with other Sovereigns, to
give the <i>Popes</i> now and then a touch of the Spur, thereby
to oblige them to go on in the right way, the management of
Affairs at <i>Rome</i> would be very expedite, and the Ministers
of Princes would not meet with so many difficulties: Which I
leave, with the rest, to the consideration of the
<i>Spaniards</i> and other Princes.</p>
<p>Some Ministers there are, who flatter themselves into a belief
that they may be able to bring their Negotiations to a prosperous
end, by means of the friendship they have with Cardinals, and the
great Interest these Cardinals have to defend those Princes of
whom they are intitl&rsquo;d Protectors.</p>
<p>But this Opinion of theirs hath no other effect but to
confound their Negotiations so much the more, whilst the
Protection of Princes by those Cardinals is only external and
nominal: for otherwise Policy obliges them to seek in the first
place the advantage of the <i>Pope</i>, before the profit of the
Princes, whom they serve, or at least seem to serve.</p>
<p>Every blow of mortification which the <i>Pope</i> receives
from any Prince, recoils to the damage of the Cardinal Dignity;
and therefore the Cardinals labour to bring it about, that the
Advantages may be always on the <i>Popes</i> side.&nbsp; Nor is
it necessary to believe <a name="page2_123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>the Cardinal, who professeth,
<i>That the Interests of his Prince are dearer to him</i>,
<i>than those of the Scarlet Gown it self</i>.</p>
<p>But this would be a great failure in Policy and Interest:
Whence it was, that when <i>Innocent</i> beheld his Cousin
<i>Olympia</i> anxious and troubled lest the Ecclesiastical State
should become involv&rsquo;d in a War, and lest many Cardinals
should engage in it on behalf of the Duke of <i>Parma</i>, out of
spight to the <i>Pamphilian</i> Family, the <i>Pope</i> comforted
her with these words; <i>Cousin</i>, <i>fear nothing</i>, <i>the
Cardinals will be for us in spight of their own teeth</i>, <i>and
will defend the Ecclesiastical State in consideration of their
own Interest</i>, <i>though we should go about to ruine it for
ours</i>.</p>
<p>The Grandeur of the Scarlet Gown depends upon the Majesty of
the Triple Crown, and the Cardinals are proportionably Great as
the <i>Pope</i> is so; whence it is that they strive with all
possible ardour to promote the Advantage of the Church, and the
Honour of the <i>Pope</i>; which failing, their own Reputation
and Glory must partake in the Eclipse.</p>
<p>Great undoubtedly is the Magnificence of the Colledge of
Cardinals; and greater it would be, if it had not been perverted
both from the first Institution thereof, and retrench&rsquo;d of
the Prerogatives wherewith it hath been augmented by divers
<i>Popes</i>, for the maintenance of its Grandeur and Honour.</p>
<p>But the <i>Popes</i> have corrupted and spoil&rsquo;d all;
inasmuch as into that Colledge, into which the greatest Princes
of the World think it a glory to enter, they have
introduc&rsquo;d some, who have received their Original from the
vilest Dunghil of the World; and &rsquo;tis not many years ago,
that one was created Cardinal, who was the Son of a base
Catchpole.</p>
<p><a name="page2_124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>Hence it comes to pass, that the <i>Popes</i> seeing
the Scarlet Robe upon the Shoulders of so vile and unworthy
Persons, they despise it likewise when it is worn on the backs of
Great Princes.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis more than true, That good
<i>Popes</i> honour the Cardinals, when such Honour brings profit
to themselves; otherwise they make a mock both of their Persons,
and their Order.</p>
<p>And hence it is, that Princes Ministers find themselves in a
wrong Box, when they put any trust even in those Cardinals who
seem the greatest Zealots for their Interests.</p>
<p>Thus I have made a Relation of the manner how things are wont
to be negotiated at <i>Rome</i>, and shew&rsquo;d how the great
Polititians of <i>Europe</i> may salve their Reputations; as also
the Grounds and Causes of those Mischiefs, which break the sleep
and make the heads ake of as many Publick Ministers as reside in
<i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>When the <i>Pope</i> perceives that Negotiations tend to his
own Advantage, he doth things like an absolute Monarch: but when
he knows that they are likely to cause any prejudice to him, he
lays the cause of not succeeding upon the Congregations of the
Cardinals, of which there are infinite at <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>In this manner he shews himself rather as Head of a
Commonwealth, than an absolute Prince: and indeed those
Congregations serve more for a pretext and help to the
<i>Pope</i> and the Nephews, than for any benefit to the
State.</p>
<p>From such a Government little Fruit, and no Satisfaction can
be drawn by the Ministers that negotiate at <i>Rome</i>; but
rather, as accordingly it falls out, disgusts, affronts, and
dissatisfactions.</p>
<p><a name="page2_125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>In
the <i>Roman</i> Court there passes not a day without reproaches
against the <i>Pope</i> and Nephews, as those who study nothing
else but to accommodate themselves, and incommodate all others
that endeavour the good of the State and the Church.</p>
<p>Greater attendance and application cannot be, than that of
<i>Alexander</i> the Seventh both to Civil and Ecclesiastical
Affairs; and which is most considerable, he doth all things with
such an eagerness, that he appears to take no small glory
therein.</p>
<p>He lets not one day pass without giving publick Audience, at
least very seldom, unless those Infirmities which are his
constant Companions indispose him to follow his good intentions;
as it hapned for these days lately passed, wherein for a good
while together he was not able to give Audience to the Embassador
of <i>France</i>.</p>
<p><i>Innocent</i> undertook things slowly, and this slowness
spoil&rsquo;d all; but <i>Alexander</i>, being most contrary to
such a nature, enterpriseth every thing with great ardour: and
this spoils all too, the Ship being lost oftentimes as well
through too little Wind, by falling into the hands of Enemies, as
likewise through too great a Wind striking upon Rocks.</p>
<p>The Ministers of Princes even still find very great
difficulties in negotiating at <i>Rome</i>, and perhaps greater
too than those which they found in the time of <i>Innocent</i>;
who indeed intangled things, because he would not extricate them:
but <i>Alexander</i> confounds matters by too great eagerness to
rectifie them.&nbsp; <i>Innocent</i> lov&rsquo;d not to meddle,
but with those things whereunto he was enforced; but
<i>Alexander</i> thrusts himself upon such as might better be let
alone.</p>
<p>Hence &rsquo;tis that Ministers seeing the <i>Pope</i> employ
his <a name="page2_126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>mind on a thousand businesses of Christendom, and but
of a weak and infirm constitution, they forbear to trouble him;
as Cardinal <i>Mazarine</i> and <i>Don Lewis d&rsquo; Haro</i>
did, who would not let the <i>Pope</i> have any hand in the
Treaty of the last Peace, to the no small displeasure of the poor
<i>Pope</i>, who was ambitious to receive his part of the glory
in a business so important to the Universe.</p>
<p>That which makes publick Agents at <i>Rome</i> thus backward,
is the knowledge they have of the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> mind; who
is inquisitive and curious to know every thing, to have a hand in
every action, to pry into all the affairs of Christendom, and
briefly, to lade himself with so many businesses, that he must
needs precipitate them all through want of strength to carry them
on: whence &rsquo;tis that oftentimes he answers one Minister
concerning certain matters of which he had conferr&rsquo;d with
another, and so confounds both himself and them that negotiate
with him, who for fear of further embarassing the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> understanding are fain to break off their
most important Audiences.</p>
<p>In the beginning of his Papacy, being ambitious of glory, he
would needs sustain alone the weight of all the world, not only
of the State Ecclesiastical, in the middle whereof he
lean&rsquo;d upon others, but did not cast the burden wholly off
from himself; and at present now he approaches towards his end,
his infirmities enforce him to leave others to do, that which it
grieves him that he cannot do for others.</p>
<p>Matters were well believ&rsquo;d, but ill understood at the
first entrance of the Cardinal Patron and <i>Don Mario</i> into
<i>Rome</i>: and now they are well understood, but ill
believ&rsquo;d.&nbsp; These Lords began to Reign with their Eyes
shut, and their Ears open; and at present, <a
name="page2_127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the Style
being changed, they rule with their Ears shut, and their Eyes
open, whence proceeds the multitude of inconveniences to publick
Agents.</p>
<p>The Cardinal <i>Patron</i> exercises the Office of his
Patronage, in giving himself Patronage for enjoying his
pleasures, and avoiding, as much as possible, all hard and knotty
affairs; which are wont to perplex the mind, and confound the
brain of a Gallant.</p>
<p>Hence it is, that Embassadors, who treat with him, reap no
other good but a fardle of Complements, and pleasing Expressions,
with no small hope that he will act abundantly; but in reality he
doth nothing: so that they depart from his Presence outwardly
satisfi&rsquo;d, with their hands empty of any thing of
substance.</p>
<p>I have known some Ministers, who have believ&rsquo;d they
might speed in their publick affairs by the easiness of knowing
the secrets of the Court; which is of great use to a publick
Agent, namely, to know the actions, treaties, and conveniences of
others, and to keep his own, and those of his Prince, secret.</p>
<p>Indeed, the secresie of the Court of <i>Rome</i> seems not to
be so great as the subtilty, although Excommunications and
Censures make a great noise: For those who are introduc&rsquo;d
into this Court are so only for two ends, either to exalt their
Family, and support it from falling, (for the Ecclesiasticks,
having no Wives, naturally encline to enrich their own Nephews)
or else to aggrandise themselves, out of that ambition which
alwaies lies under the Robes of Prelacy.</p>
<p>The Cardinals, however sometimes vertuous and experienced
persons, are not exempt from certain imperfections which commonly
reign in <i>Rome</i>; for they <a name="page2_128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>are either oblig&rsquo;d to Princes
by a thousand benefices and gifts, or else are their natural
Subjects: and for this reason the Princes who have great concerns
with <i>Rome</i>, the more they see Authority and Offices of any
Cardinal increas&rsquo;d, the more they study how to oblige him
to be at their devotion, and to withdraw him from that of the
<i>Pope</i>.</p>
<p>Now almost all the Cardinals reveal the things which they
pretend to discover, either through the importunity of
inquisitive Agents, and not to disoblige those to whom they are
oblig&rsquo;d, or else to put greater obligations upon the
Princes to whom they are Pensioners, to the end they may receive
gratuity after gratuity both to themselves and their Kindred, and
especially that they may be assisted in their Pretensions to the
Papacy, when the See Apostolical shall become vacant; which is
the greatest spur of all.</p>
<p>To this Embassadours trust, and alwaies treat with the
Cardinals who are adherents to their Masters, to discover the
Counsels by their means.&nbsp; But indeed, they deceive
themselves; for the Cardinals being as much concern&rsquo;d as
the <i>Pope</i> in the defense of the Church, the State, and the
publick good, in regard all are in capacity to be <i>Popes</i>,
they will never reveal any thing which may prejudice that Papacy
which makes them great, and which they aim one day to govern.</p>
<p>The Cardinals are not so indiscreet as to reveal any thing
that may in any wise prejudice the Interests of the Papacy and
Ecclesiastick State; they reveal such things as may be of
prejudice to the single person of the <i>Pope</i>, or rather of
his Nephews, whom commonly they hate through envy.</p>
<p><a name="page2_129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>The
effect hereof is, that most <i>Popes</i> put little trust in the
Cardinals when any matter relating to their own House is in
agitation, but they do all <i>motu proprio</i>: for themselves
having, whilst they were Cardinals, revealed what they ought to
have kept secret, they doubt, being afterwards <i>Popes</i>, that
others do the like by them; and for this cause they secure
themselves, as much as possible, from such dangers.</p>
<p>The Papal Excommunications, which are great against those that
reveal the secrets of the <i>Roman</i> Court, as well Temporal
persons as Spiritual, have no other effect but to put all into
confusion, and to cause ambiguities on all sides.&nbsp; Hence
such things as are revealed, seem not really to be so, but only
intimated; and consequently no small prudence is requisite to
understand what is spoken, because the revealers fearing the
sting of the Excommunication within their breasts, utter only
doubtful, perplex&rsquo;d, and ambiguous words; by which means
such Agents, as think themselves illuminated by such revelations,
soon after find themselves puzzled and confounded.</p>
<p>The cause hereof is the fear, which Excommunication begets in
the breasts of the scrupulous.&nbsp; But it is true in general,
that to mingle things certain with doubtful, is proper to the
<i>Roman</i> Court; and things true with false, to the
Ecclesiasticks.</p>
<p>But the Ecclesiasticks being less guilty of valour then fear,
(for oftentimes they fear even their own shadows) the more
important things are, the more they consult about them; which the
<i>Popes</i> do, not because the good of the State requires it,
or the care of their Pastoral charge urges their consciences
thereunto; but only to take from their successors the occasion to
charge the blame of mischief upon their <a
name="page2_130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>Nephews.&nbsp; And this is the cause that Negotiations
are prolonged, publick Ministers confounded, and poor Christendom
so embroiled, as it is at this day.</p>
<p>Ambassadors at <i>Rome</i>, especially in the beginning of a
Pontificate, think they treat with the new <i>Pope</i> as a
person disinteressed, and the Universal Father, not only in
reference to things pertaining to the Church, but also to the
civil Interests of Princes, and affairs most important to the
Universe.</p>
<p>But they deceive themselves, and this Error confounds their
Treaties; whilst the <i>Popes</i> have nothing but the bare Title
and outward shew of Universal Father, acting all things according
to the dictates of their own will and interest.</p>
<p>Were the <i>Popes</i> really Universal Fathers, they would
love all alike, and deal with all without affection or hatred:
But truly, I know not how they dare assume that Title, especially
those <i>Popes</i>, who, without any need of the Church, have
made it lawful to themselves to begin Wars, hinder Peaces,
persecute Nations, and make Leagues against Crowns,
Commonwealths, and Princes, perhaps (nay without perhaps) better
deserving of the Church, and affected to the publick and
universal tranquillity.</p>
<p>I know that if the <i>Popes</i> would deserve the Title of
<i>Universal Father</i>, they out to be Universal towards all;
and if at any time to be particular, it should be either out of
absolute necessity of Reason of State, or some great importance
to the honour of the Church.&nbsp; Thus did the Primitive
<i>Popes</i>, but within these last hundred years things are
altogether transform&rsquo;d; for the waies of the <i>Popes</i>
are directed to the advancement of their Families; whence every
<i>Pope</i> has often chang&rsquo;d his thoughts and purposes,
and <a name="page2_131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>made shew of one thing outwardly, and meant another
inwardly; not for that reasons of State (but the reasons of their
own Families) so requir&rsquo;d: which latter are commonly more
dear to the <i>Popes</i> than the former.&nbsp; The Ministers of
Princes understand what I mean.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis not possible for the most expert Minister at
<i>Rome</i> to succeed well, and with his Master&rsquo;s
satisfaction, in the things which he negotiates there.&nbsp;
Before I give a reason whereof, I will relate what I read three
daies ago in a little book, whether Historical or Fabulous I know
not, but much to the purpose.</p>
<p>They say, <i>Pope Paschal</i> the second took a conceit to
have an Astrologer divine his thoughts.&nbsp; To which end he
sent for an Abbot very intelligent in the Art of Astrology, and
demanded of him, <i>What himself thought</i>?</p>
<p>The Abbot surpris&rsquo;d at this odd-proposal, desir&rsquo;d
time to answer, and returning home fell to study an Answer; but,
not being able to find one fit and proper to the Question, he
remain&rsquo;d much troubled and melancholy.</p>
<p>His Cook observing it, and understanding the cause, bid his
Master take courage, and leave the business to him; for he would
effect it with reputation to them both.&nbsp; The Abbot was well
pleas&rsquo;d with this discourse, and being desir&rsquo;d by the
Cook to let him have his Gown and other Habit, gave him it:
wherewith the Cook being cloath&rsquo;d, repair&rsquo;d to the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> presence, and that with the more confidence,
for that he was in person and voyce very like the Abbot.</p>
<p>The <i>Pope</i> no sooner beheld him, but taking him for the
Abbot, <i>Well</i>, (said he) <i>What do I think</i>?&nbsp; The
<a name="page2_132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>bold
Cook answer&rsquo;d without delay, <i>Your Holiness thinks you
speak with the Abbot</i>, <i>but &rsquo;tis with the Abbots
Cook</i>.</p>
<p>Not much different is that which befals Embassadours of
Princes who negotiate at <i>Rome</i>; where the <i>Popes</i> are
wont to do like the <i>Jackpuddings</i> of a Play, who change
themselves in a moment from Man to Woman, and from a Physician to
a Muleter.</p>
<p>When an Embassadour thinks he treats with a Temporal Prince,
and about Civil matters, &rsquo;tis with a Spiritual Bishop, and
about matters Ecclesiastical.&nbsp; Religion serves the
<i>Pope</i> to disguise Temporal Dominion, and Temporal Dominion
to disguise Religion.&nbsp; Religion precedes Policy, if the
Affairs of Embassadours be contrary to the Policy, which the
<i>Popes</i> have in their heads: Policy precedes Religion, if
the Embassadours Strengthen and confirm the particular Policy of
the Popes.</p>
<p>If perchance a publick Agent treats a League offensive or
defensive with the <i>Pope</i>, he finds greater difficulties
therein than he imagin&rsquo;d; for if the <i>Pope</i> see that
the League brings much more profit to himself than to the Prince
that desires it, he concludes as a Temporal Prince, without
derogating from the Authority Spiritual: That is, he reserves a
secret clause in his mind to break, the League when he will,
under colour of Religion: But if he know that the League is
likely to bring much more advantage to the interest of the Prince
than to his own Family, and to Religion than to his own Purse;
excuses are immediately in the field, and the <i>Pope</i>, of a
Sacred High Priest, becomes a secular Prince, denying to do any
thing, for fear of hazarding the State.</p>
<p>The Ministers of the Emperour and the King of <a
name="page2_133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span><i>Poland</i> can witness what I say, for one of them
hath often sworn to me, That the <i>Popes</i> do in businesses so
confound the Sacred with the Profane, and Religion with Policy,
that it is not possible to know whether it be better, to treat
with them as Temporal Princes, or as Secular Lords.</p>
<p>Amongst all the difficulties which Embassadours meet with at
<i>Rome</i>, this is the greatest and most deserving to be
mentioned.</p>
<p>They that enter upon the Government at <i>Rome</i>, are
ordinarily at their entrance destitute of all vertue, much more
of Political skill; and no sooner begin to be a little acquainted
therewith, but they must go off, and give place to others, that
enter with like qualifications.</p>
<p>The <i>Burgheses</i> had never manag&rsquo;d any kind of
publike affair: nevertheless as soon as <i>Paul</i> was made
<i>Pope</i>, they became Masters without having ever been at
School, and undertook to weild a Scepter, before they had passed
the Ferula.</p>
<p>Cardinal <i>Ludovisio</i> had never gone out of his little
<i>Podere</i>, where he entertain&rsquo;d himself from morning to
night amongst those Peasants, sometimes in playing at Hazard, and
sometimes in dancing Country Jigs, till, his Uncle being become
<i>Pope</i>, (<i>Gregory</i>) he left <i>Podere</i> for the
<i>Vatican</i>, the Dance for the Court, hazard for fortune, and
the Peasants for Princes; passing in a moment from the command of
a Cottage to the Empire of the Church, and from small affairs to
the great interests of the World.</p>
<p>Of the <i>Barbarini</i>, one was fetcht from the bottom of a
Cloister, where he had scarce learnt to command a Butler to lay
the cloath; another was taken from the Colledge of the Jesuites,
where he had practised <a name="page2_134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>only to run up and down the stairs
of the Oratory; a third was taken from the cure of a small
Benefice; and the forth from a state of Domestick peace to
command Armies.&nbsp; A fair turn indeed, no less wonderful than
unexcted: yet these Lords have had this particularity, that
though they entred upon the government of the Church extremely
ignorant, nevertheless in a few daies they became Masters of
Masters, and seem&rsquo;d old, although but boys, in the
subtleties of this Court.</p>
<p>Of the two Nephews of <i>Innocent</i> the tenth, the one
legitimate, the other adopted, we have spoken sufficiently, and
need not rub the sore again; in regard they manifested themselves
altogether unexpert, the one by renouncing the Hat, as unable to
bear the weight of command; and the other by being expell&rsquo;d
the City, for venturing to command beyond his
understanding.&nbsp; For all this <i>Innocent</i> introduced them
to a vast Government, and laid upon their backs that world which
the most expert are hardly able to sustain.</p>
<p>What shall we say of <i>Don Mario</i>, <i>Don Augustino</i>,
and Cardinal <i>Flavio</i>?&nbsp; What Governments, Employments,
and Charges had they ever possess&rsquo;d in their lives?&nbsp;
Was it not a fine sight to see <i>Don Mario</i>, who had never
worn a Sword in his life, declared <i>Generalissimo</i> of the
Holy Church, receiving at the same time, with the General&rsquo;s
Truncheon, a Licence to keep the Sword alwaies in the
Scabbard?&nbsp; For when he offered to draw it, and swore to
defend the Church with it, the <i>Pope</i> dispens&rsquo;d with
him; saying, <i>Brother</i>, <i>put thy Sword up into thy
Scabbard</i>, <i>if thou wilt have part in my Kingdom</i>.&nbsp;
To which Command <i>Don Mario</i> hath been alwaies obedient.</p>
<p><a name="page2_135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>When the Cardinal was called to the Government, he was
reading the Fables of <i>&AElig;sop</i>, and <i>Don Augustino</i>
was making love to a little Courtisan of <i>Siena</i>: and yet on
a sudden the latter was called from the arms of a base Strumpet,
and made worthy of the Marriage of a great Princess; and the
other from his Pastime of <i>&AElig;sop</i>, was admitted to the
management of the greatest Affairs, not of <i>Rome</i> only, but
of the whole World.</p>
<p>Now what prosperous issue can Negotiations have with such a
Race of Politicians?&nbsp; Where shall Embassadors begin, at the
Head or the Tail?&nbsp; What devices shall they have to unfold
their meaning to such as want sense?&nbsp; Unless all
<i>Popes</i> should imitate <i>Gregory</i> the Fifteenth, who in
the beginning of his <i>Papacy</i> would not treat of any
important matter with any Minister, but excused it by saying,
<i>That he would stay till his Nephews were a little instructed
in Political Negotiations</i>: And he had reason to stay, for in
a short time one of them had an ambitious Whimsey came into his
Crown, that he understood more than all the Cardinals, and his
Uncle to boot; and accordingly he acted and commanded, without
communicating with either.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis a tedious thing to Princes Ministers, who are old
Stagers in Councils and Affairs, to have to do with raw,
unexperienced Persons, and such as are much different from the
Primitive Governours of the Church; who, though introduc&rsquo;d
barefoot, and ill clad, and void of all experience, yet their
native simplicity serv&rsquo;d them very well for the preserving
a virtuous Life, far from Political cunning: whereas the Nephews
of the present <i>Pope</i> enter simple, not to edifie the
People, and adorn the Church with good <a
name="page2_136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>Lives;
but to Lord it over Princes by Policy not comprehensible.</p>
<p>Most Agents lose their time in learning the nature of those
that bear sway at <i>Rome</i>, who are indeed unknown to
all.&nbsp; They study in what manner to treat with such
Persons.&nbsp; They strive to gain the affection of those
Governours, who are without any, unless we will say, That they
have given up all their affection to heap up Money.&nbsp; They
labour to ingratiate with those Nephews who possess all the Grace
of the <i>Pope</i>: And in a word, Night and day they contrive to
know and be known to the Nephews at <i>Rome</i>, in order to
their better success there.</p>
<p>But what? in the fairest of these Intrigues, after so many
watchings and toils, after having understood those whom they
understood not before, in the greatest heat of their
Negotiations, in the beginning of their joy for having found out
the right way of managing Affairs, and whilst they are beginning
to lay open their Interests to Persons by this time arriv&rsquo;d
to some capacity, behold the death of the <i>Pope</i> falling out
on a sudden, drives from the <i>Vatican</i> and from the
Government those Nephews who are now understood and
experienc&rsquo;d, to introduce others ignorant,
unexperienc&rsquo;d, and so void of all Political Knowledge, as
never to have seen the Court but on the outside, Consultations
but in Sport, nor Publick Ministers save in their Coaches.</p>
<p>In this manner poor Embassadors are forced to turn over a new
leaf, and like young Scholars put to a new School, they must
learn over again what they had learn&rsquo;d before, to their no
small dissatisfaction, as well as injury to their Affairs.</p>
<p>These so sudden shiftings of the Scene, puts the <a
name="page2_137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Ministers
all in disorder; and the only satisfaction they find, is to laugh
at the new Princes of the Church, who have so suddenly
leap&rsquo;d from the Dunghil to the Throne.</p>
<p>Cardinal <i>Onofrio</i> Brother to <i>Urban</i> the Eighth,
who was taken from a Cloister of <i>Capucines</i>, and
introduc&rsquo;d into the Affairs of the Court, could never
accustom himself to live in any other manner, but in that
slovenly way of the <i>Capucines</i>; so that when he was to
receive any Embassadors, he committed the most ridiculous pieces
of clownishness imaginable.</p>
<p>One day speaking about some War of the <i>Turk</i> in
<i>Germany</i>, with the Imperial Embassador, who desir&rsquo;d
him to prevail with the <i>Pope</i> to succour Christendom, which
was endanger&rsquo;d in that Country; the good Cardinal fetching
a great sigh, began to say, <i>Ah</i>, <i>my Lord Embassador</i>,
<i>those Coleworts</i>, <i>those Coleworts in the Capucines
Garden</i>, <i>make me always remember my former condition</i>;
and so continuing a Discourse of a quarter of an hour, concerning
the goodness of Coleworts, the excellence of Turneps, and the
manner how the <i>Capucines</i> boil them in good fat broth;
seeming to lick his fingers almost at every syllable, and to
swallow a Turnep at every word.</p>
<p>Another time going to visit the <i>Spanish</i> Embassador, and
forgetting himself to be a Cardinal, and not a Capucine, he
ask&rsquo;d on a sudden, <i>Of what Covent is your Reverend
Fathership a Son</i>?</p>
<p>The Embassador, perceiving the simplicity of the Person,
answer&rsquo;d him laughing, <i>Father</i>, <i>I am no Son of a
Covent</i>; <i>but indeed I send Sons to the Covent</i>, <i>of
whom perhaps your Fathership is one</i>.&nbsp; The Cardinal
finding his error, thought to mend it by replying to the
Embassador, <i>Your Excellence may please to excuse </i><a
name="page2_138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span><i>me</i>; <i>for the remembrance of the Capucines is
so fresh my mind</i>, <i>that I take all for Capucines that speak
with me</i>: The Embassadour laught; and rising up, said,
<i>&rsquo;Tis well</i>, <i>my Lord</i>, <i>I will be gone
then</i>, <i>that I may not be accounted a Capucine by your
Eminence</i>.</p>
<p>Moreover, whilst Ministers of Princes talk&rsquo;d with him of
matters of State, the answers he return&rsquo;d were about
watering of Gardens, sweeping of hutches, ordering of Vestries,
rising in the morning, entring into the Choire, begging Alms, and
so of all such other things, wherein he was a Master.&nbsp; Nor
did he make any difference of persons in his Conferences, but
us&rsquo;d the same Style to every body, <i>Your Fathership will
pardon me</i>.&nbsp; And in his Complements with Embassadours
Royal, he would often say, <i>I shall accompany you to the door
of the Cloister</i>.</p>
<p>I might relate a thousand such stories, but I will not
lengthen the work more than I ought; although there is scarce any
Nephew of <i>Popes</i> whose mean and carriage, after their
sudden advancement to the degree of Princes, affords me not
matter for a long discourse.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis enough that publick Ministers cannot forbear
laughter and scorn in their negotiating with them which serve to
inform them of their infirmities.&nbsp; Whence the Embassadour
<i>Justiniani</i>, being ask&rsquo;d one day, <i>whether he was
goeing to negotiate with</i> Astalli?&nbsp; Answer&rsquo;d,
<i>Not to negotiate with him</i>, <i>but to instruct
him</i>.&nbsp; And indeed, such instruction is extreme necessary
to the best of them.</p>
<p>But that which displeases them most, is, that after much pains
taken to instruct them, they must lose the fruits thereof, and
begin all the same course over again with their Successors.</p>
<p><a name="page2_139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>The
last difficulty in managing affairs with the Nephews, ariseth
from their incomparable Avarice, which is so predominant in them,
that they appear meer insensible Statues in every thing else, but
in studying the means how to make themselves great.</p>
<p><i>Boniface</i> the ninth was the most dextrous, subtle, and
ingenious <i>Pope</i> for accumulating wealth, that ever sate in
the <i>Vatican</i>; whence he was wont to say, <i>That he had
rather have a little Fish in hand</i>, <i>than a great Dolphin in
the main Sea</i>; And at other times, <i>That an Egg in the
morning is better than a Hen at night</i>.&nbsp; And accordingly,
he was contented to lose the interest of a whole year to
anticipate the payment of a day, and he alwaies made his
Receivers bring him every night the money they had collected; and
sometimes he would sit up till midnight expecting them, in regard
he could not sleep otherwise through fear of being undone.</p>
<p>This exorbitant Covetousness wholly withdrew his mind from the
care of the Papacy, both in Civil and Ecclesiastical matters;
Embassadours could not please him better, than to discourse to
him of the means to get money; and when they mentioned other
matters pertaining to the publick good, they receiv&rsquo;d no
answer sutable to the question; because his thoughts were not
imploy&rsquo;d about what the Embassadours spoke, but about what
the Receivers of Gabels and Taxes had said to him; with whom he
entertain&rsquo;d long conferences, little caring to give
audience to Embassadours.</p>
<p>Clement the seventh, who never shew&rsquo;d himself so
extraordinarily covetous, though covetous too, had his mind
distracted in the like manner, from what was at any time spoken
to him, if it were not about <a name="page2_140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>money: Whence being one day
requested by the Imperial Embassadour to joyn with the Emperour,
and other Princes, in a League against the Turk; the Embassadour
perceiving that the <i>Pope</i> gave him no answer, said, <i>Your
Holiness saies nothing to my Proposal</i>; Whereunto the
<i>Pope</i> return&rsquo;d, <i>No</i>, <i>for you counsel us to
spend money</i>, <i>and we are thinking on the means to get
it</i>.</p>
<p><i>Paul</i> the fourth, standing one day in a great musing in
the presence of Cardinal <i>Campeggio</i>, was ask&rsquo;d by
him, <i>Why he stood so pensive</i>?&nbsp; The <i>Pope</i>
answer&rsquo;d, <i>I am thinking whether you</i> (<i>who perhaps
may be my Successour</i>) <i>are likely to be richer than my
self</i>.</p>
<p><i>Sixtus Quintus</i>, who was one of the greatest
<i>Popes</i> that the <i>Vatican</i> ever saw, had no other
fault, but that he spent most hours of the day in devising what
might be done to bring money into his Chests.&nbsp; And he seems
to have died with the same thoughts in his head; for being
ask&rsquo;d by the <i>Venetian</i> Embassadour, two daies before
his death, <i>How he did</i>?&nbsp; He answered, <i>I should be
much better</i>, <i>if I had more money to spend</i>.</p>
<p><i>Urban</i> the eighth, in the war he had with the Duke of
<i>Parma</i>, and other confederate Princes, lost no little
reputation, in attempting the destruction of a Prince so well
deserving of the Church, and hazarding the safety of all
<i>Italy</i>; yet he car&rsquo;d not so much for the dishonour
which the Church receiv&rsquo;d in his person, nor for the great
murmur of the people, as for the money disburs&rsquo;d in it;
lamenting the same often with his Nephews, and reproving them for
<i>having engaged him in a War of so great expence</i>: as if the
loss of money made deeper impression in the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i>
heart, than the detriment of the Church and of Christendom.</p>
<p><a name="page2_141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>Most of the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Nephews call the hours
wherein they give Audience to Embassadours, <i>hours of
poverty</i>, <i>and of misery</i>; because they cannot at those
times think how to advance their Houses: and therefore they
strive to shift them off as much as possible, and many times they
promise all before &rsquo;tis ask&rsquo;d, only to be at their
liberty.</p>
<p>Some will not allow it to be meerly charity in
<i>Alexander</i>, to assume to himself the load of all Civil
Affairs of importance; but only a design to lighten his Nephews
of it, and leave them more time to bestow on contrivance to fill
their Coffers.</p>
<p>Better perhaps &rsquo;twould be for the Church, and the State
too, if all <i>Popes</i> would do the like; for to lay the weight
of great affairs upon such weak shoulders, is to confound their
understandings, and put them in danger of shaming themselves by
discovering their addle brains in business: As a good Nephew did
in discourse with the French Embassadour about the number of
Protestants in <i>France</i>; for meaning to say, <i>How many
Hereticks are there in</i> France?&nbsp; He mistook, and said,
<i>How many Pistols are there in</i> France?&nbsp; Which errour
the Embassadour well observing, and knowing the Cardinal Nephew
more intent on the money of his Coffers than the benefit of the
Church, he answer&rsquo;d, <i>The King my Master hath not so many
Hereticks in his Kingdom</i>, <i>as he hath Pistols in his
Exchequer</i>.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis not 2000 Ages, since a certain <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i>
Nephew said to a familiar friend of his, who brought him notice,
that the Spanish Embassadour was coming to negotiate with him:
<i>These Embassadours bring us business</i>, <i>and not
money</i>, <i>talking all day long with us so </i><a
name="page2_142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span><i>tediously</i>, <i>as if we were slaves</i>, <i>and
not</i> (Padroni) <i>Masters of the Church and State</i>.</p>
<p>The same Cardinal, as often as he return&rsquo;d to his
Chamber from accompanying the publick Ministers (who had visited
him) to the door, as the custom is, would fall into a passion,
and scornfully say to his Servants: <i>I have lost two hours time
with this pitiful Embassadour</i>, <i>and he has gain&rsquo;d
some with me</i>; <i>if any other come</i>, <i>say I am not at
home</i>.</p>
<p>But worse was that other, (not long since dead) who, as much
as he could, avoyded the audience of such Ministers, sometimes
pretending indisposition, and sometimes that he was not at home;
which the <i>Pope</i> his Uncle understanding ask&rsquo;d him the
reason, <i>Why he did so</i>?&nbsp; The Cardinal answer&rsquo;d
plainly, <i>Whilst I am with Embassadours</i>, <i>my Coffers fill
with nothing but wind</i>; <i>but when I am alone</i>, <i>they
fill with money</i>.</p>
<p>The same good Nephew had another custome, that when notice was
given of the arrival of an Embassadour at the Gate, he would in
displeasure cry, <i>I would his neck were broke</i>.&nbsp; But
when &rsquo;twas told him that an Officer of the Datary (that is,
the Exchequer) was at the door, he would cry with joy, <i>He is
welcome</i>.</p>
<p>A certain Embassadour, knowing this Nephew&rsquo;s humour,
contriv&rsquo;d how to make his Visits not grievous; and to that
purpose, before he desired Audience, or at least at the same
time, he thought fit to give him notice; that he desir&rsquo;d to
speak with him for nothing else but the resignation of a certain
Benefice, which the Prince his Master intended to make into the
hands of his Holiness&rsquo;s Nephews.</p>
<p>The device took well, for the greedy Nephew believing <a
name="page2_143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>it true,
receiv&rsquo;d him with a very good countenance: and the
Embassadour fail&rsquo;d not to usher in his publick business
with a Preface about resigning the foresaid Benefice or Abbey,
although the Prince his Master knew no more of any such thing
than I; and so got a fair reception.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twere good, that all publick Agents would put the same
tricks upon those avaricious Nephews, and not be so scrupulous as
they are; since the Nephews make no scruple to slight their
addresses, to breake off all Negotiations, and to confound
whatsoever is offer&rsquo;d to them.</p>
<p>Without such inventions they are like to get little good from
the visits to the Nephews, who consider nothing but their own
Interests, and are indifferent to those of Princes; whence
&rsquo;tis easie to judge they will do little good in those
matters, in which they are engag&rsquo;d with an ill will.</p>
<p>This may serve concerning the difficulties which Princes
Ministers meet with in their affairs with the <i>Popes</i> and
their Nephews, and how to avoid the same.&nbsp; Let us now
proceed to the Enquiry, <i>Why the Families of</i> Popes
<i>continue not long in Grandeur</i>.</p>
<p>Some compare the <i>Nipotismo</i> to a Tree which is guarded
by all, whilst laden with fruit; but as soon as it happens to be
deprived thereof, either by the hands of men, or progress of
time, every body forsakes it, and nature her self leaves it
barren, dry, and hateful, even to the eye of the beholders.</p>
<p>I do not altogether like this comparison, because Trees bear
fruit for others; whereas the good Nephews of <i>Popes</i> take
all to themselves: and I should rather compare them to Pismires,
which all day long go from place to place, seeking provisions
wherewith to <a name="page2_144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>fill their Nests, and stop not a moment till they see
them full.</p>
<p>There is no body but wonders to behold how the Families of
<i>Popes</i> daily decline, there being scarce two found that
have continued one intire Age, or which remain in the same
splendour wherein they were seen to shine, not only during the
Reign of the <i>Popes</i> their Kinsmen, but for some lustres
after; and although some may seem at present to be found great,
yet my Observation cannot therefore be decry&rsquo;d as false, in
regard of other reasons to be alledged concerning this
matter.</p>
<p>There is no doubt, but many Families are found at this day in
<i>Rome</i> of good quality and esteem, who have had <i>Popes</i>
descended from them before <i>Sixtus</i> the fourth; as the
Family of <i>Conti</i> hath had two <i>Popes</i> in the
<i>Vatican</i>, <i>Innocent</i> the third, and <i>Gregory</i> the
ninth; The Family of <i>Fiesco</i>, reputed at present the chief
Family of <i>Genoa</i>, hath likewise afforded two <i>Popes</i>,
<i>Innocent</i> the fourth, and <i>Adrian</i> the fifth; And so
that of <i>Orsini</i>, hath had <i>Nicholas</i> the third; That
of <i>Savelli</i>, <i>Honorius</i> the fourth; <i>La
Gaettana</i>, hath had <i>Boniface</i> the eighth;
<i>Picolomini</i>, <i>Pius</i> the Second; <i>Colonna</i>,
<i>Martin</i> the fifth; not to mention others, that have had
their <i>Popes</i> too.</p>
<p>But this is the difference: &rsquo;tis one thing for
<i>Popes</i> to issue from a Noble Family, and another for
Families to rise from the <i>Popes</i>.&nbsp; The foresaid Houses
received not their Splendour, Nobility, and Wealth from the Papal
Grandeur, but it may rather be said, that the Papal Grandeur
received splendour from those Families.</p>
<p>Besides, in those daies the Nephews of <i>Popes</i>
remain&rsquo;d at home, and did not come to <i>Rome</i>; if they
<a name="page2_145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>did,
they brought not with them that insatiable avarice which Nephews
bring (or have brought hitherto) when they enter into possession
of the <i>Vatican</i>.&nbsp; I mean not therefore to speak of
those Families, which have been in great esteem as well since
they have had <i>Popes</i> of them, as before.&nbsp; None of
these is advanc&rsquo;d by the Papacy, but remains in the same
manner without growth in Ambition, Riches, or Glory.</p>
<p>Particularly, the House of <i>Colonna</i> (which is at present
one of the most considerable, not of <i>Rome</i> only, but of all
<i>Italy</i>) hath so little valu&rsquo;d the Papal Grandeur in
its lot, that they have often persecuted it, only to let the
World see that the <i>Colonneses</i> pretended not to glory in
the Treasures of the Church, but in the merit of the persons,
exemplified in the valour of so many illustrious men, who have
spent much of their bloud for the service of the <i>Popes</i>
themselves.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis certain, that by two <i>Popes</i> issu&rsquo;d out
of the House of <i>Colonna</i>, the <i>Colonneses</i> have had so
little advantage, either in dignity or wealth, that they may say
that the <i>Popes</i> were taken out of their Family, and that
they have the honour to be <i>Colonneses</i> of the House of
<i>Colonna</i>, but not <i>Colonneses</i> of the House of
<i>Popes</i>.&nbsp; But there are many other Families, whose
glory it is to have had their rise from the fortune given them by
<i>Popes</i>, without which they would never have been any thing
considerable; and these are the Families of which I am to
speak.</p>
<p>The Family of <i>Rovere</i>, from which <i>Sixtus</i> the
fourth was descended, of it self was very noble, and had
liv&rsquo;d so for above two Ages in <i>Lombardy</i>, but by
various changes and accidents it was declin&rsquo;d to such <a
name="page2_146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>a degree
that the chief branch was remov&rsquo;d to <i>Savona</i>, and
there remain&rsquo;d many years in a mediocrity of fortune
amongst the principal Citizens, till <i>Sixtus</i>, being made
<i>Pope</i>, determin&rsquo;d to revive it to a greater fortune
at the cost of the <i>Vatican</i>, and the publick Treasury.</p>
<p>All the glories of this House, though dispersed here and there
by <i>Pope Sixtus</i>, yet in a little time became confined to
the sole possession of the Dutchy of <i>Urbin</i>, which indeed
the House of <i>Rovere</i> possessed, but not without great
persecutions for the space of 150 years and more, beginning from
1475 till 1631.&nbsp; When the said House was extinguished by the
death of <i>Francesco Maria</i>, the last Duke, or of <i>Guido
Ubaldo</i>, if I remember right; there remaining no other Heirs
save <i>Donna Vittoria della Rovere</i>, married to
<i>Ferdinand</i> the second great Duke of <i>Tuscany</i>.</p>
<p>It may be said, as I shall afterwards prove, that this was the
only Family (rais&rsquo;d by <i>Popes</i>) that continued so long
together in greatness: and I believe the goodness of the Dukes,
who succeeded one after another, contributed not a little to this
continuance, which seems to surpass the ordinary measures.</p>
<p>But if we will measure things with the right rule, we shall
find that the Family of <i>Rovere</i> liv&rsquo;d in Grandeur but
one Age; for there is no necessity to begin to reckon from the
time of <i>Sixtus</i>, but from <i>Julius</i> the second, who was
of the same House; who seeing it much declin&rsquo;d by reason of
the great persecutions of <i>Alexander</i> the Sixth, determined
to succour it, though not by burdening the Church, which was in
the year 1510.&nbsp; Neither is it needful to extend the
reckoning till 1631. because for above twenty years before the
death of the last Duke, the Ecclesiasticks <a
name="page2_147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>foreseeing the fall of the Dutchy into their own hands,
in regard of the great age of the Duke and his want of male
Children, they resolv&rsquo;d to take possession of it by
degrees; and accordingly insulted over the poor old Duke, keeping
him as if he had been their Subject: wherefore it may reasonably
be said, that the House of <i>Rovere</i>, rais&rsquo;d by
<i>Sixtus</i> continu&rsquo;d not in grandeur so much as one full
Age.</p>
<p>The Family of <i>Cibo</i> hath alwayes produc&rsquo;d men
eminent both for Learning and Valour; amongst whom there were two
<i>Popes</i>, <i>Boniface</i> the ninth, and <i>Innocent</i> the
eighth; the former in these dayes, when Nephews were not wont to
enter into <i>Rome</i> with the <i>Popes</i>, and the latter
immediately after the death of the abovementioned
<i>Sixtus</i>.&nbsp; But this Innocent the eighth would not
oppress the Church to enrich his Kindred, whom he saw wealthy
enough, and of good account amongst the chief Citizens of the
Commonwealth of <i>Genoa</i> his Countrey.</p>
<p>He gave them indeed some Offices, but of so small value, that
this <i>Popes</i> Kindred did not think it worth while to leave
<i>Genoa</i> for <i>Rome</i>, and so, after the death of
<i>Innocent</i>, they despis&rsquo;d their Citizenships of
<i>Rome</i>, and return&rsquo;d to <i>Genoa</i>; where within a
short time by the fault of Cardinal <i>Cibo</i>, they left the
Offices given them by the <i>Pope</i> their Kinsman, and were
forc&rsquo;d to betake themselves to other courses for a
livelihood; well knowing that the Riches receiv&rsquo;d from the
Church stay not long in the hands of the receivers.&nbsp; And
they did wisely, for had they remain&rsquo;d at <i>Rome</i>,
perhaps they would not be at this day in that grandeur, esteem,
and <a name="page2_148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>wealth as they are in the City of <i>Genoa</i>.</p>
<p>Of the Family of <i>Alexander</i> the Sixth, that barbarous
Pope, there would be much to say, did not the consideration of
bravity oblige me to pass over many reasons of the destruction
thereof.&nbsp; This <i>Alexander</i> was descended from the noble
Family of <i>Lenzoli</i> in <i>Spain</i>, being Son of
<i>Goffredo Lenzoli</i>; but containing both the name and surname
of his family, he took that of <i>Boria</i>, which was afterwards
turn&rsquo;d to <i>Borgia</i>.</p>
<p>From this Pope sprung the house of <i>Borgia</i>, and was by
him encreas&rsquo;d and advanc&rsquo;d to that grandeur, whereof
we have spoken in other places.&nbsp; It was divided into two
branches, one whereof remain&rsquo;d in <i>Spain</i> in
possession of its ancient honours, and the other came into
<i>Italy</i>; where it became so great by the many Principalities
conferr&rsquo;d on it by the Pope, that it seem&rsquo;d likely to
flourish to eternity.&nbsp; But on the contrary, in less than
half an Age, it decayed so fast, that &rsquo;tis above fifty
years since the Family of <i>Borgia</i> became extinct in
<i>Italy</i>.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis true, the Branch in <i>Spain</i> continues in some
splendour, and possesses at present the Principality of
<i>Squillace</i>, which was given by Pope <i>Alexander</i> to his
Family.&nbsp; But this Principality is no great matter, <i>Don
Ferdinando Borgia</i>, the present Possessor little caring for
it, for the same reason, as some think, of being purchas&rsquo;d
with the money of the Church; and glorying only in his possessing
what his Ancestors had got by their valour, and himself gets by
the good service he performs to the Crown, which reckons him one
of the chiefest men of <i>Spain</i>.</p>
<p>After the Introduction of <i>Nipotismo</i>, the Family <a
name="page2_149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>of
<i>Picolomini</i> had another Pope, to wit, <i>Pius</i> the
third, who lived so short a time, that he was fain to leave his
Kindred <i>Picoli huomini</i> (small men) indeed; although they
have kept themselves in the rank of Nobility, by having
receiv&rsquo;d considerably from the Church, but only for eminent
services perform&rsquo;d to the same.</p>
<p>We have spoken sufficiently of the House of <i>Rovere</i>, and
though <i>Julius</i> the second, who was of it, might induce us
to speak of it here again: yet for brevities sake, we will pass
to the Family of the <i>Medici</i>, which was indeed
amplifi&rsquo;d by, but not first rais&rsquo;d by <i>Popes</i>,
but rather the<i> Popes</i> rais&rsquo;d by it.</p>
<p><i>Leo</i> the tenth did his utmost to render his House
potent, not in <i>Rome</i> only, but also in <i>Florence</i>;
where it was one of the chiefest of that Commonwealth.&nbsp; But
what this <i>Leo</i> could not, <i>Clement</i> the seventh (of
the same Family) effected, having with the Emperours assistance
enthralled his own Countrey to make his Nephews Princes.</p>
<p>This House hath maintain&rsquo;d it self for above 300 years
together in greatness, and I believe will so continue, because it
stands not on the same foundation with other Families of
<i>Popes</i>.&nbsp; First, because (as I said before) it has
rather given <i>Popes</i> to the Church, than receiv&rsquo;d
Being from the <i>Popes</i>, without need of whom it kept it self
long in grandeur.&nbsp; And though at first view the great height
of this House may seem to be of right attributed to the force,
which <i>Clement</i> the seventh us&rsquo;d to enslave his
Countrey, and render his Kindred Princes: Yet this is not
pertinent to the question; for <i>Clement</i> took not from the
Church to give to them, but only destroy&rsquo;d a Republick,
which was an obstacle to <a name="page2_150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>the eyes of all <i>Popes</i>, and
where his Family was already in chief command.&nbsp; Besides, the
<i>Medici</i> were therein as much oblig&rsquo;d to the House of
<i>Austria</i>, by whose Force and Power they undoubtedly
receiv&rsquo;d the Principality which they possess with so much
glory.&nbsp; And accordingly <i>Ferdinand</i> the second and his
Ancestors have alwayes shewed themselves most grateful for the
benefit.</p>
<p>The Family of <i>Farnese</i>, which is that of <i>Paul</i> the
third, Successor to <i>Clement</i>, came out of <i>Germany</i>
into <i>Italy</i>, in company of the Emperours, who often made
this Voyage attended by a great number of <i>Dutch</i> Gentlemen;
here the chief of this Family gave in divers cases great proofs
of their valour, and were therefore preferr&rsquo;d by the chief
and most Potent Princes of <i>Italy</i> to greater Dignities and
Offices than those which they had possess&rsquo;d at home, as
well Civil as Military, whereof they acquitted themselves
well.</p>
<p>The <i>Popes</i> especially were ambitious to have them at
their service, and by their means obtain&rsquo;d sundry
Victories; without which &rsquo;tis likely the Church would have
been in great distress.&nbsp; In the Papacy of <i>Paschal</i> the
second, in the year 1100.&nbsp; <i>Pietro Farnese</i>, Captain of
the Cavalry of the Church, did wonders in its service, having
obtain&rsquo;d a most glorious Victory against the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Enemies on the Coasts of <i>Tuscany</i>,
restoring to <i>Costano</i> the name of <i>Orbitello</i>, a very
ancient Colony, and replenishing the same with much people.</p>
<p><i>Prudentio</i> Son of this <i>Pietro</i> under the Papacy of
<i>Lucius</i> the second, and <i>Pepone</i> and <i>Panuccio</i>
Sons of <i>Prudentio</i>, under the Papacy of <i>Innocent</i> the
third, effected great things in defence of the Church, <a
name="page2_151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>which was
greatly afflicted with the Schism of the Emperors.</p>
<p>The Grandfather of <i>Paul</i> the third was <i>Ramecio
Farnese</i>, who overcame, subdu&rsquo;d and destroy&rsquo;d all
the Rebels of the Holy Church, which in great numbers molested
the State Ecclesiastical, and almost all Christendom, he being
Captain of the Papal Army in the time of <i>Eugenio</i> the
fourth, who indeed was a very worthy <i>Pope</i>, if for nothing
else, yet for the good intention he had to reward the valour of
this great Captain; and I think he rewarded him abundantly by
this testimony which he gave him, <i>The Church is ours</i>,
<i>because Farnese hath given it us</i>.</p>
<p>In short, in the Civil Broils, which continu&rsquo;d for above
four Ages between the <i>Popes</i> and the Emperors, the Family
of <i>Farnese</i> with incredible valour and felicity
reliev&rsquo;d the drooping state of the Holy Church.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the last <i>Popes Urban</i> and <i>Innocent</i>,
ingrateful for these benefits, went about to ruine this well
deserving Family.&nbsp; Now if they persecute those who with
their own Blood and Fortunes have serv&rsquo;d the Church, what
man will ever serve it for the future?</p>
<p>These two Cities were indeed separated from the Church, and
given to the <i>Farnesi</i>, who at first found great opposition,
and became Masters of it with great difficulty, and that not
before the time of <i>Pope Julius</i> the third, in the year
1550. which <i>Pope</i> gave them investiture in despite of
<i>Charles</i> the fifth, (who could never be perswaded to
consent) and assigned them a considerable summe of money for the
keeping them.</p>
<p><a name="page2_152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>Within this last forty years the <i>Popes</i> have
persecuted these innocent Princes in that manner, that without
the assistance of Forreign Crowns, and some of the Princes of
<i>Italy</i> they had been exterminate before this, and received
so notable a loss, that had it been compared with what they had
received from <i>Paulus</i> the third, it would doubtless have
been found they had received less than they had lost: from whence
it may be justly said, they have not enjoyed that Principality
which they possest, as a feud of the Church, in that peace and
repose, for this last half age, as they ought in reason to have
done.&nbsp; For those <i>Popes</i> that gave it them first, gave
them also priviledges to enjoy it without molestation: and
therefore those <i>Popes</i> that have of late troubled the
<i>Farness</i> with so much expense, ought in reason (if there,
be any such thing in <i>Rome</i>) to have forfeited their feudale
Rights.</p>
<p><i>Julius</i> the third, he also failed not to do his part
towards the raising of his Family, which was of the <i>De
Montes</i>, by giving them several offices, and sums of money, by
which means in a short time they became very great; but half an
age was not past, but it began by degrees to decay and shrink
into that mediocrity it is in at this day: which is but small in
respect of the condition it was in after the death of
<i>Julius</i>, who saw them advanc&rsquo;d, but did not live to
see their declension; it being a general Maxime amongst all the
<i>Popes</i> Nephews, that they see them advanc&rsquo;d but to
the highest pitch of honour, but live not to see them fall to the
lowest point of disgrace.</p>
<p>But the greatest Family of all was the <i>Caraffi</i>, <a
name="page2_153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>rais&rsquo;d to that height by <i>Paul</i> the fourth,
though of it self for several Ages before, very illustrious: The
authority they had in <i>Rome</i>, with the command of several
Lands and Castles belonging to the Church, made this name like to
be eternal, and being fortified with such strong banks, not at
all subject to the injury of time.</p>
<p>But if ever any Family of the <i>Popes</i> were in a short
time precipitated from the greatest height to the lowest of
meanness, it was this of the <i>Caraffi</i> from <i>Paul</i> the
fourth, which continued not four year in that Splendour and
Eminence the <i>Pope</i> had plac&rsquo;d it, he himself having
laid the foundation of their greatness and ruine.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding <i>Paul</i> the fourth left his Nephews no
small store of Riches, although they were banisht from
<i>Rome</i>: which they enjoyed till <i>Pius</i> the fourth was
preferr&rsquo;d to the Chair; who being <i>Pope</i>, and not able
to endure their insolencies, he got them into his hands; and
forming a Process against them, he hang&rsquo;d some of them,
beheaded others, and sequestred their Estates, destroying in that
manner the House of the <i>Caraffi</i>, with no small gust to the
Romans, who frequently declared their dissatisfaction with the
behaviour of the <i>Caraffi</i>.</p>
<p>But some will object, that the House of Caraffi, do at this
present flourish in <i>Naples</i> in great honour and wealth, and
may be reckoned amongst the Principal there as well for Splendour
and Magnificence, as Wealth, of which they enjoy not a
little.</p>
<p>To this may be answered with the same reason I have alledged
before, where I spake of the house of <i>Borgia</i>, divided into
two Branches, one <a name="page2_154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>in <i>Spain</i>, the other in
<i>Naples</i>; for the House of the <i>Caraffi</i>, when
<i>Paul</i> the fourth was made <i>Pope</i>, was divided also
into two Branches, one of them remaining in <i>Rome</i> by the
acquisition of a new Estate, the other in <i>Naples</i> in
possession of what they had got before.</p>
<p>The Lords of the <i>Caraffi</i> enjoy at present in
<i>Naples</i> many Signiories, as particularly the Dutchy of
<i>Matalone</i>, which they had enjoyed a hundred years before
<i>Paul</i> the fourth, without interruption, being anciently
Dukes from the time of <i>Ferdinando</i> first King of
<i>Naples</i>, and reckon&rsquo;d amongst his principal
Favourites; and are still esteem&rsquo;d of very well by the
Crown of <i>Spain</i>, though in the revolutions of
<i>Naples</i>, upon I know not what considerations, the affection
<i>Philip</i> the fourth had for a long time for the Duke of
<i>Matalone</i>, was observed to grow cold.</p>
<p>This Branch that remained in <i>Naples</i> received no benefit
or advantage by that which was establish&rsquo;d in <i>Rome</i>,
which last being extinguish&rsquo;d by the two <i>Popes</i>
aforesaid by the death and sequestration of so many
<i>Caraffi</i>; the other remained in <i>Naples</i> daily
augmenting by the favours and priledges they receive from the
Crown of <i>Spain</i>.</p>
<p>Neither are the Neopolitan <i>Caraffi</i> of the same
condition with the Roman, they having nothing, as many believe,
or at least, very little of the Church Lands in their possession,
which continued not long to the other House, not so much as to
the second Generation; and therefore these Lords are still so
considerable in <i>Naples</i>, because their Estates sprang
rather from the reward of their valour, than the oppression of
the poor.</p>
<p><a name="page2_155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>All
this notwithstanding, the People of <i>Naples</i> were always
disaffected to the House of <i>Matalone</i>; for which reason in
the Revolution of <i>Masanello</i>, <i>Don Joseph Caraffa</i> was
slain by the fury of the People, his heart pull&rsquo;d out of
his breast, and his body drawn all about the City, with this
Exclamation, <i>This is he that betray&rsquo;d the most faithful
People of Naples</i>.&nbsp; Besides, there were several Palaces
of the Dukes, full of inestimable Furniture, burnt, without being
able to preserve one; and I being then in <i>Naples</i>, heard
several cry, <i>We must burn all</i>, <i>to purge the House
of</i> Caraffa <i>from the Leprosie of the rest of the</i>
Caraffi; alluding to them who in the time of <i>Paul</i> the
Fourth had made themselves odious to all the World, as well as to
<i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p>The Family of the <i>Buoncompagni</i> was considerable above
thirty years after the death of <i>Gregory</i> the Thirteenth,
which was the Person rais&rsquo;d them to that height; for though
before they were in some degree of Nobility, yet their Estate was
but narrow and small; however in the twelve years of his Papacy
he let them get so much, that without any great difficulty, they
liv&rsquo;d like Princes after the death of that <i>Pope</i>, who
died in <i>March</i> 1585.</p>
<p><i>Giacomo Buoncompagno</i>, General for the Holy Church, left
many Sons all rich, and allied to good Houses; notwithstanding in
a short time all was consumed: and though there was not one
lavish or profuse person in the Family, though they had several
Cardinalships and other Charges in <i>Rome</i>, yet could not all
prevent their growing worse every day: And had not two Marriages
sustained them, and put them into the condition they are in,
which yet is but mean in respect of the grandeur they were in
before, they <a name="page2_156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>had certainly before this been destroy&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>But the greatest wonder, in the particular of the sudden
destruction of the <i>Popes</i> Families, was in the House of
<i>Peretti</i> rais&rsquo;d by <i>Sixtus</i> the Fifth.&nbsp;
That <i>Pope</i>, to immortalize his Name, and the Grandeur of
his House, which was but of very low extraction, married two of
his Nephews, or Nephews Sons, I know not which, into the
principallest Families in <i>Rome</i>; giving each of them
considerable Estates in Land, and an infinite quantity of Money:
and that it might not meet with any untoward accident to subvert
it, he settled their Estates in the surest and best places he
could, thinking thereby to secure and establish his Family.</p>
<p>Ten years after the death of <i>Sixtus</i>, there were seven
Males of the House of <i>Peretti</i> alive, that is, in the year
1600. all of them very rich; but particularly they which had the
Inheritance of Cardinal <i>Montalto</i>, who left his Nephews an
Estate of a hundred thousand Crowns in yearly Rent, besides what
they had afore.</p>
<p>Many People conceiv&rsquo;d this Family was establish&rsquo;d
for ever; and who would not have thought so, considering the
number and fertility of the Males, their Alliance with the
greatest Families, their Riches, and in short, their enjoyment of
all things necessary to the immortalizing a Family?&nbsp; Yet the
Name, the Wealth, the Granduer of this House, did all vanish like
smoak at the death of Cardinal <i>Froucesco Peretti</i>, who died
in the beginning of <i>Innocent</i> the Tenth&rsquo;s Papacy,
with no small trouble to the <i>Romans</i>, who loved his person
exceedingly, having found him full of actions of generosity and
nobleness to all that had to do with him.</p>
<p><a name="page2_157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>And
so was the House of <i>Peretti</i> extinct, not being able to
continue half an Age.&nbsp; Yet notwithstanding, the death of the
Cardinal was the rise of another Family from the <i>Pope</i>,
which is called the <i>Savelli</i>, into which one of his Sisters
was married, who remained Heir to a vast and inestimable
Patrimony.&nbsp; Some People are confident, That if the House of
<i>Peretti</i> had continued, the <i>Savelli</i> would have been
in an ill condition; so as there was no great hurt done, to lose
one Family, and have another rais&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>The House of the <i>Sfondrati</i> yielded to the Papacy
<i>Gregory</i> the Fourteenth, who though sprung from
<i>Milan</i> himself, yet nevertheless as to his Original, he may
not improperly be styl&rsquo;d both the Son and the Father of
<i>Cremona</i>, a Town (considering its Antiquity) amongst the
principal of <i>Italy</i>, besides that, it has in all times
produc&rsquo;d men very eminent both in Learning and Wars.&nbsp;
In this City, amongst the most considerable Citizens, was this
House of <i>Sfondrati</i>, always enjoying the greatest Office in
the Council, which procur&rsquo;d no small envy in the hearts of
many; insomuch as some people excited the <i>Cambiaghi</i> (which
was then a Family of great credit and esteem in the City) to
oppose themselves against the Ambition of the <i>Sfondrati</i>,
who at that time appear&rsquo;d to carry all before them.</p>
<p>The <i>Cambiaghi</i>, back&rsquo;d and supported by other of
the Citizens, endeavour&rsquo;d what they could the diminution of
the <i>Sfondrati</i>; and from hence arose (not to say Civil
Wars) great feuds and animosities between them, which continued
till such time as <i>Girolamo Sfondrati</i> was called to
<i>Milan</i>, where meeting with greater Advancements, he
resolved to leave <i>Cremona</i> <a name="page2_158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>for ever: And from this Family, now
become <i>Milanese</i>, <i>Gregory</i> the Fourteenth descended,
who would always acknowledge <i>Cremona</i> to be his Country;
yet would declare often, whilst he was a young Student there, He
would never return to <i>Cremona</i>, till he was made Bishop of
that place: Afterwards arriving at a competency of years, and
other qualifications, he begg&rsquo;d and obtain&rsquo;d very
readily the Bishoprick of <i>Pius Quartus</i>, being a person of
great worth: He was also made Cardinal whilst he was in
<i>Cremona</i>, with no small joy to the whole City, who made
great Expressions of their Satisfactions, by Bonfires and other
Ceremonies, at the news of his Promotion.</p>
<p>How careful this <i>Pope</i> was of his Relations, we have
sufficiently shewed in its proper place: &rsquo;tis enough that
not contented with the Marriage of two of his Nephews, towards
the perpetuation of his Family, and one of them in particular
with the Daughter of the Prince of <i>Massa</i>; he
design&rsquo;d also to make <i>Emilius Sfondrato</i> his Brothers
Son, who was already entred to the Degree of Holy Orders, to
resign his Cardinals Cap: but propounding of it to the
Consistory, the Cardinals apprehended it a business of so great
scandal, they intreated him to content himself, that he had
married two Nephews, that were already furnished with Children,
to secure the continuance of his Family for ever, without any
such hainous and unjustifiable courses.</p>
<p>But all this avail&rsquo;d not at all; for in a short time
after the death of the <i>Pope</i>, in a Months time there were
three Males of that Family died, as it were by Judgment from
Heaven, to mortifie the ambition of those <i>Popes</i> who
destroy Heaven it self, to fill the World with their
Nephews.&nbsp; And thus by little and <a
name="page2_159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>little
the House of <i>Sfondrati</i> declined, with all the diligence
and care they could use to hold out full forty years, though they
made another Person take their Name upon him, that had neither
Alliance nor Friendship with them.</p>
<p>Of the House of <i>Aldobrandini</i>, from whence
<i>Clement</i> the Eighth proceeded, who was created <i>Pope</i>
in <i>January</i> 1592. we cannot speak without touching the
Cardinal <i>Aldobrandino</i> too neerly, who is the only person
sustains the Name of a Family, that seem&rsquo;d, for the Reasons
before, impossible to be irradicated; which may notwithstanding
be said to be extinct, although the Cardinal bears the Name, and
the Princess of <i>Rossano</i> enjoys the Estate, as Heir to the
House of <i>Aldobrandino</i>; yet the one being a Woman, and the
other a Priest, they cannot hope to recover it, unless some
By-blow should be produc&rsquo;d: which, though it would be a
neat piece of invention, I cannot imagine, because the Cardinal
was not at all scandalous in his Life, but always obsequious and
respectful of the Princess; who made him Cardinal, and without
which he might have been a <i>Brandino</i> a Jugler, but no
<i>Aldobrandino</i>.</p>
<p>But to return to <i>Pope Clement</i>, I will affirm, That he,
not having fail&rsquo;d in any thing might furnish <i>Rome</i>
with the Family of the <i>Aldobrandini</i>, was not in arrear to
his Name.&nbsp; In the time that he was <i>Pope</i>, there were
eighteen Males of the Name of <i>Aldobrandini</i>, the greater
part of which were married; and it was no small satisfaction to
him, to have so great a number of his Relations: upon which score
he us&rsquo;d to say, <i>He was</i> Pope <i>of</i> Rome, <i>and
Prince or Chief of the</i> Aldobrandini.</p>
<p><a name="page2_160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>That which was most observable was, He took great
pleasure in caressing his Relations; for when any of his Brothers
or Nephews that were married came to him, he would tell them,
<i>Let it be your business to provide Children</i>, <i>and it
shall be mine to provide them Estates</i>.</p>
<p>His good Kindred did not neglect to make their advantage of
the Counsel of <i>Clement</i>, nor he to maintain their Honours;
by which means, there was scarce any other Family taken notice of
in <i>Rome</i>; but the reputation of this, made a noise in every
corner.</p>
<p>This House of the <i>Aldobrandini</i> was well founded in the
<i>Papacy</i> of <i>Urban</i> the Eighth, by the assistance of
seven Brothers, Grand-children to <i>Clement</i>; all of them of
so strong and lusty complexions, the Physicians by common consent
did assert, there could not be any defect of Posterity.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, it has fail&rsquo;d; and which is very
considerable, there is not now one Male remaining of the
Name.</p>
<p>The House of <i>Borghese</i> descended from <i>Paul</i> the
Fifth, who succeeded <i>Clement</i> (though <i>Leo</i> the
Eleventh, who liv&rsquo;d but five and twenty days, was betwixt
them) ran the same fortune; but being of a later Plantation in
<i>Rome</i>, it conserves still some weak and decrepit
Branches.&nbsp; One of the principal designs <i>Alexander</i>
had, to marry <i>Don Agostin</i> with the young Princess
<i>Borghosa</i>, was to unite the Estate and Patrimony of that
tottering and declining House, with the House of <i>Chigi</i>,
which at that time was rising to great Emminence, though for a
while they came not to <i>Rome</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page2_161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>There was but one sprig left of the House of the
<i>Borghesi</i>, and which was worse, even that of a weak temper,
and much subject to infirmities: which <i>Alexander</i>
considering, and what accidents the vicissitudes of the world
might bring upon the house of the <i>Borghesi</i>, he applyed all
his endeavours to make a match (which succeeded well) with his
Nephew, and gave him fair hopes of seeing the Patrimony of the
<i>Borghesi</i> in his own house.</p>
<p>And this is the state of the <i>Borghesi</i> at present, who
in the time of <i>Paul</i> the fifth, had above a dozen males of
that name, of which there were not above six married; which was
very considerable.&nbsp; But I return to speak how squares go in
the world.</p>
<p>The Families of the <i>Ludovisi</i>, <i>Barbarini</i>,
<i>Panfili</i>, and <i>Chigi</i>, who yielded the four last
<i>Popes</i>, I shall speak nothing of; because they have not
enjoy&rsquo;d the Benefits of the Papacy full out thirty years:
so as it behoving us to let them rest in peace, I shall leave the
observations of their Catastrophe to them which come after
us.</p>
<p>One thing only I shall insert, that the <i>Aldobrandini</i>
had at one time many more males alive, than are at present left
of all these four houses together.</p>
<p>God Almighty bless them according to their own desire; which I
do heartily pray, as having no animosity against those that are
good.</p>
<p>Some have observ&rsquo;d, and not with much difficulty, that
the greatest part of the <i>Popes</i> Families were, before their
advancement to the Papacy, of great antiquity and grandeur; but
for many that rais&rsquo;d themselves by the treasure of the
Triple Crown, it is not so easie to finde; for instead of
attaining to a perpetuation of their Families, they have not <a
name="page2_162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>been
prolifique enough to defend them against a perpetual
annihilation.</p>
<p>The house of the <i>Medici</i> in <i>Milan</i> was of above
two hundred years antiquity, maintaining it self in great Honour
and Magnificence: But after <i>Pius</i> the fourth was elected
<i>Pope</i> out of it, it grew worse and worse, declining with
much more speed than it was rais&rsquo;d, and that after so
extravagant a manner, they could discern themselves rise, but
could not perceive their decay.</p>
<p>So the house of <i>Gregory</i> the fourteenth, who was born as
I have said of the ancient Family of the <i>Sfondrati</i>, who
had made themselves, as it were, immortal in <i>Milan</i>, not
only in respect of the greatness of their Authority, but in the
multitude of their Issue; yet in less than forty years after
<i>Pope Gregory</i>, its leaves fell, and the whole Tree of the
<i>Sfondrati</i> withered.</p>
<p>The House of <i>Aldobrandini</i> also, from which
<i>Clement</i> the eight was descended, from the time of the
<i>Lombards</i> to the said <i>Pope</i>, continued so eminent in
<i>Florence</i>; there was at several times three and twenty of
that name chief Standard-bearers, and all elected by the people:
Nevertheless as soon as there was a <i>Pope</i> of this Family
(which was <i>Clement</i>) it began to decay, and is now at that
pass, there is but one sprig left of all the branches, and that
infertile and incapable of recovering them, though he should be
made a <i>Pope</i>.</p>
<p>In short, a thousand other examples might be produc&rsquo;d to
evince what I have asserted; which examples though I have
describ&rsquo;d in History, yet are they enough to demonstrate
the <i>Popes</i> and their dependents, that all the care,
contentions, <a name="page2_163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>and designs they go through for advancement of their
particular Families, are not blessed by the Lord; because he
suffers them not to prosper: it being more then certain, That
when he keeps not the City, the Watchmen wake but in vain.</p>
<p>God Almighty not suffering those who have rais&rsquo;d
themselves to that greatness, out of the Bowels of those that are
in Purgatory, themselves to remain long without punishment for
their faults.&nbsp; He will not permit those Families that are
elated and grown insolent with the wealth and blood of those poor
carkases that are buried in their Churchyards, to continue long
in this world themselves.&nbsp; Heaven is offended to behold
sacred things transformed into profane, Churches into Palaces,
Alms into Thefts, Crosses into Swords, Altars into Lordships,
Holy things into Comedy and Sport, Divine Worship into an
adoration of Riches, or rather adoration into Riches.</p>
<p>He that shall be pleas&rsquo;d to run over the actions of all
the <i>Popes</i>, that is, the History wherein all the Families
that have afforded any <i>Popes</i> to the world, Shall finde
this for an infallible truth, that they are either all as it were
extinct, or the small remainder that is left reduc&rsquo;d to a
very mean and inconsiderable condition: As if heaven could not
endure the Patrimony of Saint <i>Peter</i> should be made an
universal scandal to the world, and be an occasion of eternizing
the memory of the Sacriledge they have committed.</p>
<p>I had lately an opportunity of discourse with an Abbot born in
<i>Rome</i>, and experienc&rsquo;d in their transactions: falling
into some speech about the Nephews, and finding their vices, or
at least errors <a name="page2_164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>by him, with more vehemence reprehended, than by me, I
took the courage to accost him in this manner, <i>How is it
possible</i>, <i>Sir</i>, <i>that the Nephews of the Popes that
are living</i>, <i>reading the lives of their Predecessors that
are dead</i>, <i>that their Blood should not freeze in their
veins to finde them extinct</i>, <i>some one way</i>, <i>some
another</i>, <i>in spight of all their care to eternize
themselves</i>? <i>how is it possible but some gripes of
Conscience must torment them when they remember all their wealth
belongs to the Church</i>?</p>
<p>The Abbot would suffer me to go on no further, but cutting me
off in the middle, he reply&rsquo;d, <i>Sir</i>, <i>He which has
too much money</i>, <i>has no time to read over the lives of them
that are dead</i>; <i>money puts thoughts alwayes into their
heads of eternizing themselves</i>, <i>sometimes by
acquiring</i>, <i>sometimes by contriving</i>: <i>The</i> Popes
<i>Nephews do read Books</i>, <i>but it is only when they want
money</i>, <i>and then &rsquo;tis too late</i>.</p>
<p>And who is there now, would not be amaz&rsquo;d at such an
answer?&nbsp; For my part I believe all the Romans are of the
same opinion, and are in much doubt of the salvation of the
Nephews.&nbsp; And accordingly another of them of judgement
little differing from the Abbot, told his friend; <i>That the
Popes Nephews must of necessity go to Purgatory</i>, <i>for they
would be asham&rsquo;d to go into Paradise</i>, <i>where Christ
was</i>, <i>whom they had so wickedly despoil&rsquo;d in this
world</i>.</p>
<p>These expressions perhaps may seem but raillery, and appear
but satyrical reflections at first sight; however they come from
the very heart, though those that speak them may force themselves
into a smile to dissemble it, as the Apothecary conceals the
nauseousness of his pills by covering them with silver.</p>
<p><a name="page2_165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>A
great part of the sober men in <i>Rome</i> have been very serious
in discovering the cause, why the <i>Popes</i> Families are of so
little duration, seeing their riches so vast.</p>
<p>Some are of opinion, it proceeds from the reasons abovesaid,
that is, that God Almighty takes them out of the world as a
punishment for the injuries they have done the Church, in robbing
it of the greatest part of its treasure, to make their own house
insolent and high.</p>
<p>Others are of opinion the Curses and Execrations of the people
do pierce the Divine Ears in such manner, that the Divine Justice
seems as it were oblig&rsquo;d to take them away so immaturely,
to give an account of the vileness of their behaviour towards the
subjects of the Church.</p>
<p>And indeed the people of the Ecclesiastical State are so ill
satisfied, and so ill treated by the ill Government of
<i>Rome</i>, that is by the <i>Popes</i> Nephews who domineer and
lord it over them, that from morning to night they fill the air
with their exclamations, from one corner, <i>When will there be
an end of their Extortions</i>? from another, <i>O God revenge
the cruelties of these Nephews</i>, <i>who have ruin&rsquo;d
us</i>.&nbsp; Nor do the curses thrown out against the Nephews
rest at the people only: The very Priests and Ecclesiasticks
themselves do daily sacrifice upon their Altars for the
destruction of them, who devouring all they can get, leave not
the good people so much as will pay for the celebration of a
Mass.</p>
<p>In the time the Duke of <i>Parma</i> was in Arms against the
State Ecclesiastick, then in the possession of the
<i>Barberini</i>, the Cardinal <i>Francesco</i> gave order for
the performing the forty hours prayers in <a
name="page2_166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>his
Cathedrals to incourage the People, and to oblige them to pray to
God for the extirpation of the enemies of the Church.&nbsp; But
whilst the <i>Letany</i> of the Saints was singing, a certain
<i>Roman</i> Gentleman, at the pronounciation of these words,
<i>Ut inimicos Sanct&aelig; Ecclesi&aelig; humiliare
digneris</i>, told a Friend of his that was by, <i>The Church has
no greater Enemies than the</i> Barbarini, <i>who molest it both
at home and abroad</i>, <i>so that our Prayers to heaven ought to
be</i>, <i>to be delivered from them and their Arms</i>.</p>
<p>From hence it may be argu&rsquo;d, That they who bear a secret
hatred and detestation of the Nephews, retain it even in the
Church, and the place where they ought to pardon all, and are
still contriving revenge; and because they find there is no sure
way of freeing themselves from their tyranny in this World, they
send up their Prayers privately to Heaven: As if they were afraid
of the correction of their <i>Popes</i>, who would by no means
suffer the Faithful to appeal against their enormity to the
Divine Tribunal, but for all that they do not desist.</p>
<p>Others apply the small durance of the <i>Popes</i> Families to
that Philosophical saying, <i>Nullum violentum durabile</i>, as
if the great haste and violence they use to make themselves great
were that that precipitated them: Like Plants, that by a thousand
Arts may be forc&rsquo;d to bear fruit, and that out of season:
But how?&nbsp; Those Artifices, that do offer violence, as it
were, to Nature, do not conserve it long; but, weakened by the
supernatural force, it loses in a short time its native vigour
and is not afterwards to be recovered by all the operations of
Art.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis indeed a fine sight to see a Tree bear good fruit
in Winter, if it could be made to produce for <a
name="page2_167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>several
years; but if the water they use about the Root be but a little
hotter than it ought, &rsquo;tis enough to ruine both fruit and
tree; So as the heedlesness of the Gardener may destroy all that
he thought to have done by Art contrary to Nature; for it is
necessary the Root be watered with water warm&rsquo;d to a just
proportion to secure against the frosts in the nights, and that
all convenient cultivation be us&rsquo;d: Otherwise all will be
spoil&rsquo;d, and it will be impossible to preserve a Tree that
is by Art constrain&rsquo;d beyond its own nature.</p>
<p>In the same manner it happens to the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i>
Nephews, who grow up on a sudden by a violence they themselves
offer to their reason; and marching on towards their own
greatness by unusual waies, they seem horrid and uneasie, as not
being trodden or known by other people.</p>
<p>Others there are that alledge, amongst other reasons, why the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Family are so transitory, their inexperience
in the Art of Managery which is necessary for preserving an
Estate, their wealth raining down upon them without any sweat or
trouble, or contrivance of their own.&nbsp; Like Hebrews that
despis&rsquo;d the Manna sent them from Heaven, they not only
neglect to preserve with any prudence and Oeconomy the great
quantity of Riches, which is shower&rsquo;d down into their
Chests by the <i>Capricio</i> of fortune; but even nauseate and
abhor that, which they believe unsutable to their Nature.</p>
<p>If a Country-man by accident should light upon a parcel of
<i>Rubies</i>, at first sight he would be much delighted with
their Lustre; but upon second thoughts they would but trouble and
perplex him, because he knew not the value of a thing he had
gain&rsquo;d without labour.</p>
<p><a name="page2_168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>But
what shall I say?&nbsp; There is not any thing more dangerous,
and which brings the life of man under more hazards, than the
filling the belly too full: To eat intemperately, to swallow
without measure, and to devour with eagerness and rapacity, must
of necessity destroy Nature, and be the ruine of the whole:
Sobriety is that which conduceth most to our health, because it
gives the Stomach time to distribute the meat proportionably to
the whole body.</p>
<p>The <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i> Nephews know not how to keep their
Riches, because they touch them with their hands, but do not see
them with their eyes, their greediness of heaping up on a sudden
blinding them, and not suffering them to know the true worth of
them: by which means they dwindle insensibly, and they themselves
are not able to perceive it.</p>
<p>That which is gotten without pains, is in a short time lost
without knowing the price of it: The greatest part of these
Gamesters are either such as are loose and licentious young men,
or else such as have had some good provision from fortune.&nbsp;
The first adventure, because they have not yet found a way to
live handsomly; the other, because they believe Fortune
oblig&rsquo;d to recruit them.&nbsp; The poor Trades-man, that
sweats, and carks, and toils night and day, and all to get one
poor Crown, will not certainly be so foolish to venture that in
one moment, he gain&rsquo;d with so much labour in so many
hours.&nbsp; He does well, that keeps that he gain&rsquo;d with
difficulty: and he does well, who spends that he came by
easily.</p>
<p>Were the Nephews of the <i>Pope</i> content with what
Emoluments were justly their due, without doubt the greatness and
opulence of their Families would be much longer liv&rsquo;d: But
they fill, devour, and <a name="page2_169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>cram up their Stomach with more meat
than Nature will sustain; and therefore &rsquo;tis no wonder, if
they be often forc&rsquo;d to vomit that up with violence they
had so immoderately devour&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Many have observed also, most of the <i>Pope&rsquo;s</i>
Kindred have died young too; and I could instance in a thousand
examples: But for two reasons I forbear; one is, not to grate too
much upon the Nephews of our good <i>Pope Alexander</i>, nor have
the long life of <i>Don Mario</i> cast in my dish, though indeed
it is not above ten years since he had any relation to the
<i>Pope</i>; the other is, because I have something else to think
on.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
